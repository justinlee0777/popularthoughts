The below was written by Emily Sprague of the band Florist. It comes from the song "Red Bird Pt. 2 (Morning)" on their self-titled album. I have omitted the lyrics after the first refrain. Then, I merely arranged it by introducing punctuation and line breaks using her pauses as a guide.

Worthy of critical analysis are the first verse's dangling words, denoting her thoughts thawing metaphorically, as well as the first sentence's halted rhyme; the second verse's frequent use of and's, creating tension; the third verse's truncated, jigsaw nature; and I don't think anything extra needs to be said for the fourth and last verse.

There is a winter morning, you<br/>
didn't know me yet.<br/>
It probably was snowing;<br/>
I wonder what was said<br/>
of the day's quickly going<br/>
to what will come ahead.<br/>
I don't know if I can<br/>
ever love someone like that.<br/>

You took her to the hospital, and<br/>
put her in the bed.<br/>
I can only think about that day and<br/>
what it meant<br/>
when the doctor came out and said<br/>
"You have a daughter<br/>
now."

How does it seem to<br/>
rearrange<br/>
all the images<br/>
in my mind? believe<br/>
that it happened to me<br/>
like I was lost,<br/>
but it happened all the same.<br/>

And I can hear you singing still;<br/>
wake up in the morning so the morning comes.<br/>
Where has it gone now? Where has it gone?
