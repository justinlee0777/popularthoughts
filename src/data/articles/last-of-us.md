...basically a Christian romance.

Or a monogamous fantasy, or a secular paradise.

The most interesting thing about post-apocalyptic zombie premises - has there ever been a zombie film _not_ post-apocalyptic? Romero's first film, "Night of the Living Dead"? - in my view is society's reaction, because the apocalypse is inherently a social problem. One may argue that a society is composed of individuals, as inchoate as that argument seems on further analysis. If we were analyzing something like the theater of the individual, we would get a work more akin to Samuel Beckett's <a href="http://www.samuel-beckett.net/ping.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Ping"</a>, or maybe a Bergman film. No, most people - at least, the characters an audience craves - are not so hermitic and not so withdrawn to have worlds and worlds of...useless trash inside of them. The premise of the post-apocalyptic seems existential, rather than psychological, certainly not dramatic.

Not that anyone cares about that - fine. I shall return to my prior statement. I reckon there will be spoilers.

Secular in its methods, Christian without realizing it (unsurprising, given the Israeli-American Druckmann). Bill and Frank have found the ultimate source of happiness: monogamous marriage. No one may intrude upon it; well, _people_ shall not, but faceless bad guys may, who are really just Rottweilers with guns. What a coincidence they happen to be in the post-apocalypse, where there truly are no human beings that may poke and prod into their relationship. Their passion, which veers on _rape_, or some kind of manipulative abuse, what with Frank forcing himself onto Bill with the least amount of evidence of his homosexuality (so faint even Bill did not realize it was there) on the _first day_ they met, is so strong it sustains them to their greyer years. When one of them dies, the other chooses suicide, because there is nothing more fulfilling than monogamous marriage and nothing after.

Again: secular in its methods, Christian without realizing it. Christian in that conjugal bliss is the greatest bliss in the world; one's purpose in life inevitably is to become a familial unit. Secular in that happiness is every man's North Star, the _only_ thing to pursue until the day they die. If you try to reconcile the two, your mind will be moved to madness and you'll die a gibbering mess. You can barely squint at the unholy (or rather, nonsensical) matrimony of the theological and the Epicurean.

It's also, well, simple-minded tripe. To reiterate: _no one_ may intrude upon their happiness. It is a post-apocalypse, people. Except...a post-apocalpyse would have plenty of people. No one arrived to their small community (of literally just two people) and made this proposal: "I see you two folks have a good thing going on here, I don't ask for much but I'll work my hide off if you let me"? Apparently not, as Bill and Frank become so old and frail they decide that suicide is a far superior alternative than living any longer and, you know, sharing one's wisdom and resources to help others survive the post-apocalypse where suffering is rampant.

The writers intended a staged drama, but they instead wrote a message: secularism is selfish. Worse, they pinned this badge of shame on two homosexual men. And it happens their selfishness causes them to die alone and childless, rotting on a bed and eventually eaten by worms. "That's what happens to those who defy the holy book!" No, I absolutely do not think the writers knew just what it was they were writing. It's more horrifying than the post-apocalypse.

On a final note...

Pedro Pascal is simply a wonderful actor. Even when given bone-bare lines, he still finds nuance to add onto his character and to the situation. He deserves to be nominated for a dramatic performance, though there's not much drama in the story itself. I will give credit to the writers, however: the story is ingenuously written to give Pascal, furthermore, a comedic role. There is nothing more funny watching him act, in all his bushy beauty, across from the other lead, the wooden, stiff, inconsistently-characterized and manic Bella Ramsey.

So, let us hope this is the last I will have to speak of "The Last of Us".
