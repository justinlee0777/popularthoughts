I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### Fiona Apple's Werewolf

There are songs more worthy of being written about on "Idler Wheel". (That's what I'm calling it: "Idler Wheel". Sorry Fiona.) "Daredevil" is the best all-around song, particularly that great verse beginning with "SEEK, ME, OUT!" "Periphery" is of intense psychological interest. "Anything We Want" is brutally honest. And then there's the steam of "Hot Knife".

But "Werewolf" is the one I heard first. I truly don't remember what my first impression of it was. I do recall that I wrote in the style of "Werewolf" after the first few listens. That was the age when I was poring through Everyman Library's compilation of Kafka's stories.

That's an interesting story in of itself - to me, anyway. Like Fiona, perhaps I'll be selfish and allow myself to recollect. My entry to Kafka came, like many high schoolers, from "The Metamorphosis". This was an age of darkness for me, where the mere suggestion that we carry monsters inside of ourselves frightened me. I was drawn to "The Metamorphosis" not for its psychological analysis but for its exploration into powerlessness and uselessness. Because I was a nerd.

Kafka is inscrutable. He seems approachable though he is not. In reading you learn to write and in writing you learn to read, so I wrote stories in his style. I tried mimicking that repression, that feeling of isolation, the sense of society's impenetrability. I tried possessing his knack for imagery. I tried my hand at his style of dialogue. I tried to understand his story structure. But I found only Kafka understands himself; you are but an observer of his dreams and his sense of humor, for running beneath the text is something funny. He allows these two things, the nightmare and the comedy, to coexist. I think that's why I grew away from him and began to study other writers instead.

Fiona Apple is the same way. You can't really come to understand her. Her songs are almost not songs in that they can't be shared. That's most likely because they are poems, doors into which you can enter the outer sanctum of her world. But the inner, those are the labyrinths of inside jokes and anecdotes she won't tell in her music.

You don't need to understand the artist to understand the music. This is a hard thing to grapple, even though you find it to be always true. We think that by understanding the logic and meaning of the lyrics, we arrive at the author's motivation. But some write merely to be free, and don't find freedom in communicating. For them, to show is merely enough. The latter is Kafka's motive, the former is mine.

Fiona lies somewhere in the middle. The reason I emulated her was because I understood her more. She was the means by which, instead of relating meaning through metaphor, as is Kafka's method, I related meaning directly, using metaphor as a kind of key to unravel the threads of my mind. Kafka uses the passive I, as in, things are always happening to his narrator, while Fiona uses the active I, as in, her narrator is actively feeling or doing things. This fits my personality more.

The song begins in silence and a door closing; one hears throughout the song the physical presence of the piano, creaking under her fingers. This suits me too. I think fiction is an environment where reality always threatens to burst out. The ink on a page is not an incidental feature of a novel, it somehow magically gives the words a physical presence on the page and makes you aware of the author as a mortal being. It's the same for "Werewolf". This is an artist who is unsure of everything in her life except for the song she is about to play.

The lyrics that captivated me:

I could liken you to a werewolf<br/>
the way you left me for dead,<br/>
but I admit, I provided a full moon.

Kafka wants to convince you his mythical creatures are real, whatever "real" means. Fiona here wants the imagery, but she also wants you to be aware that she only resorts to it because she can't find the words to say what she wants to say. She openly admits the inaptness of this metaphor with the line "I admit, I provided a full moon." But the metaphor, being inapt, is also apt, and beautiful, to boot. Fiona likening herself to the moon renders the moon in all its sparkling vulnerabilities, its pureness and luminance that can't stand the daylight. This play with meaning fascinated me, her having and not having the thing she wants to say.

She continues,

I could liken you to a shark<br/>
the way you bit off my head,<br/>
but then again, I was waving around a bleeding open wound.

But you're such a super guy<br/>
'til the second you get a whiff of me.<br/>
We're like a wishing well<br/>
or a bolt of electricity.<br/>
But we can still support each other,<br/>
all's we gotta do is avoid each other,<br/>
nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key.

Poems are the oldest form of fiction because they're the most playful form of writing. Writing is endlessly complex, in the same way expression is endlessly complex, but one of the key elements of poetry is direction. In prose, the _meaning_ of the words flow in one direction, from left to right, in English; they only redirect with the use of conjuctions like "and", "or" or "though", and punctuation, like ";", though even then, direction is only slightly diverted. The line break in poetry is extremely important, and doesn't always denote the end of a thought. A really skilled poet knows how to use silence, or, emptiness.

Fiona tricks you into believing she's opening herself up with the colloquial "super guy", until she brings up her defenses of self-deprecation with the "'til the second you get a whiff of me." This misdirection occurs again after "we can still support each other", followed by "all's we gotta do is avoid each other," a declaration followed by another misgiving. At the end of "wishing well" is the dawning of another analogy, which seems like a revelation, but is really not, is really another aborted attempt at grasping the truth of the situation with the following "or a bolt of electricity". The only thing stable and true is her admitting that "nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key."

She returns, with gusto,

The lava of the volcano<br/>
shot up hot from under the sea,<br/>
one thing leads to another<br/>
and you make an island out of me.

Which can be interpreted as sexual, but I see it, not necessarily as chaste, as the onset of passion, of the fluttering of emotions, of losing control of one's thoughts. The heat from her heart lets her know she is real, and not submerged. If we're still studying direction, the contrast between the lines is strong. The first two are pure imagery, almost untouched by the vehicle of metaphor; the third is another colloquialism; and the fourth is the culmination of the prior three lines, the imagery and the reality mixing into a kind of semi-truth, that she in some way feels fully formed after these emotions. But, as she says later, this is "the fiction of the fix", that even the metaphor can delude one into thinking something felt when there isn't. We come to love fiction more than real life, such that we find ourselves suddenly denuded when the fiction evaporates, as it does, more often than not.

We don't live in a world where we get to say what we want to say. We don't live in a world where there are words to say what we want to say. This is the thing I hadn't known when I was younger. Writing is important because it _approaches_ meaning, but only arrogance leads us to believe it subsumes it. I was writing to force meaning onto people. This is wrong and the backwards approach. What one writes has to have meaning to _oneself_; only then does it acquire meaning for other people. Fiona was a big component for not so much understanding that, as _accepting_ that, that what you write sometimes just doesn't mean anything and you're simply talking to yourself. Because you do need to talk to yourself, even if you're not saying anything.
