<a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/fullname-famous-composers-racism-sexism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is the most backwards article on music and race I've ever read. In the last year. Ok, in the last month.

Normally these types of articles, especially coming from Slate, aren't worth mentioning - there's just not enough meat in them. I suppose that speaks more to my state of mind. I did a Bing search of "racist composers" and found this and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/21/black-scholars-confront-white-supremacy-in-classical-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another article</a> that said Martin Luther King Jr. listening to opera was a symbolic gesture.

Or he just liked opera. I don't understand why black people can't like opera. I don't understand how the music of white composers and a black audience are incompatible with each other. It seems that these thoughts are from white people who don't like classical music and are baffled that Dr. King wasn't instead listening to someone who had the same skin color as him.

Pretty fucking racist, huh?

Did anyone consider we call Mozart "Mozart" and Beethoven "Beethoven", and not Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig Beethoven, because we all simply know who they are and no one needs to expend extra syllables to know who we're talking about? It's ridiculous anyone thought this was a conversation worth having.

The deeper meaning, that classical music is a history of white music, is more worthy of conversation, but there's not much to say. I don't understand what is distinctly "white" about Mozart and Bach. Besides their instrumentation, their influences, and the context their music was composed in, which are the _least_ things in a modern audience's mind. I'm honestly happy if an audience listens to Mozart, and says, "This is just not my thing." That is how music criticism should work. That's how _this blog works_. Critics are constantly expected to find ways to justify the canon and trim and expand it. It's a continuing dialogue based on real life interactions with art.

To say, "Oh music history is set in stone and is so white" is basically saying you don't know anything about music history, which I, someone who knows nothing, can confidently say to people who have studied more than I have.

It's your job, fuckheads, to make a case for or against music, not on the little minor shit on the music itself. "Beethoven is white" has nothing on his music. I know one thing for a fact: Beethoven has more talent in his ring finger than you do in your entire body.

If one feels musical history is full of white artists, then instead of bringing down the artists, whose fame are so assured it would be comparable to replacing the Magna Carta with "an eye for an eye", it would be better to add black artists to the canon, by rediscovering old ones and encouraging new ones. If you couldn't find any black classical artists in the past, then that's more a reflection of the social and economic circumstances of the country and not of the art form, isn't it?

I'll make this argument until my throat is hoarse: you should just add jazz musicians to the classical music canon. "Classical music and jazz music aren't equivalent blah blah blah," but why does that matter? As far as the technical complexity and thematic substance of the music goes, they are both certainly equals. Critics can make shit up if it fits the present circumstances. There are no classical composers heard in a wide context now. You might as well deprecate the old meaning of classical music and replace it with a new meaning, still respectful to the old, so that the modern public has more of an interaction with it.

If you add Coltrane, Monk, Mingus to the classical music canon it easily paints a picture of America's dominance in that field for the 20th century. They're easily some of the greatest artists in America's history, bar none. How about we frame a conversation around them? And once we do that, we show the clear connection between artists like Charles Ives and Schoenberg to our modern-day comprehension of music, and we paint a clear picture of what the state of America's music will be.

This dwelling on music history's past is only for overly sensitive, overly out-of-touch, overly simplistic people. America's history is European history, and Western Europe is full of white people. Rather than it being an issue of right and wrong, it's an issue of numbers. I literally don't understand what the issue is.

If the issue is with music criticism, dominated by white critics, then that's a separate issue entirely, right? And a small issue at first glance - who really listens to that minority of music scholars? These scholars do invaluable work analyzing the technical qualities of music - how it was composed and who it was that composed it, as well as proposing theories. If they go rogue and focus on the "whiteness" of music, who will really listen to them, when Bad Bunny and SZA are some of the most popular musicians at the moment?

And by the way, I think critics _have_ stepped up. I'm familiar with more literature written by black writers. I see the works of many black artists in museums. I hear, of course, lots of music by black musicians. I find it all interesting, even though, in the case of fiction, I don't find it matches my standard for "good". This _particular_ criticism, which seems completely out of touch with the subject of race, is what I'm criticizing. (For that reason and that reason alone, that is why a response seems unnecessary. These types of opinions are forced into the dustbin the minute they are written.)

Let's not rewrite history, a patently absurd and ridiculous thing to do, and what is tantamount to "cut off your nose to spite your face" behavior.

To not confront one's history is absolutely a cowardly, chickenshit thing to do. It only defines you if your every action is informed by it. People should instead focus on the right things to do in their present circumstances. That is part of what Dr. King meant by "The moral arc of the universe is long but it bends towards justice."

And notice how no one critiques me for saying Dr. King instead of "Dr Martin Luther King Jr."
