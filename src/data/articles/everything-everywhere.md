### Tad bit racist

You know, given that the story is about a Chinese cast depicting Chinese Americans running a laundromat cooking noodles yelling at their daughters celebrating, I dunno, New Years, the equivalent example is a Black cast depicting Black Americans playing basketball frying chicken being neglectful fathers celebrating Kwanzaa. In short, this film is pretty racist.

I wouldn't bother making a point if Michelle Yeoh herself didn't <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/michelle-yeoh-shares-an-important-message-about-representation-in-hollywood/ar-AAXCWLy?ocid=BingNewsSearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fuss about it</a>.

Chinese Americans or American Chinese or American Asians in general or whatever have been treated to a disappointing onslaught recently of representation in the form of two Disney flicks, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang-Chi_and_the_Legend_of_the_Ten_Rings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shang-Chi</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Red" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turning Red</a>", where, in the latter, the main character hangs out in an ancestral temple...in Toronto.

One can't help feel a little like Chuck D in "Burn Hollywood Burn" when "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_Miss_Daisy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Driving Miss Daisy</a>" comes onscreen.

I want to emphasize I don't think the film is offensive, I just think it's stupid. It's below my intelligence but in the way a kitten is below my intelligence: it's cute, so whatever. In hindsight, the ideal Asian ethnicity to depict onscreen would be Japanese, considering there is a longer history of integration with that community, and therefore more of a distinct identity, one would think; furthermore, there are simply more Japanese influences on cinema as a whole, so a Yasujiro Ozu-styled flick would be, well, extremely welcomed. But of course the Chinese have more numbers, and therefore more money - so it ultimately becomes an issue of greed.

### Everything but the story

But I digress.

The cast - Yeoh, Huy Quan, Hsu, Hong and Curtis - is fantastic. It's nice that the film largely takes place in the IRS building (though it doesn't have much to do with the building itself - it would make me chuckle if every universe had an evil IRS) and takes place more or less in 24 hours, as it makes the film more focused, the story tighter, the production team more creative in how to use that space for certain scenes. You forget it's a ho-hum cubicle farm, really. The action scenes are extremely memorable, the first two at the top of the pack: the fanny pack sequence, and the staircase wrestler sequence. And the film explores the whole range of universes, employing various animation techniques for some, especially for the best universe, Racoon-touille.

The film has everything but the story.

Multiverses are odd things. The most objective definition is that they are "anything that you can daydream." You swap certain details in your life for more interesting ones. Seeing that space and time are highly correlated, you would think our ability to comprehend a truly different universe is extremely limited - perhaps frustrated to complete impossibility.

So, there are two main stories.

The first one is just fine. A mother who has a mid-life crisis and an estranged daughter learns to compose herself to save the family business and reconcile with her child and, more importantly, her own identity. Cool cool cool.

But that's a story in of itself.

The second one is about a world that has developed a brilliant technology to adjust details about an individual, allowing them access to an unlimited number of skills and experiences. This technology gets abused, creating a superbeing who threatens the existence of all universes. Predictably, someone has to stop her.

That has nothing to do with the first story, really.

You may be saying, "I mean, if you saw the film, you would know it has a lot to do with it."

No, no, no. Think about it a little bit. It really has nothing to do with the first story.

How does the _logical conclusion_ of the second story, saving _all of existence as we know it_, with _explosions_, as are needed, have anything to do with reconciling with someone you love and salvaging your marriage (which really didn't seem so threatened in the first place)?

You'll say... "Sir, it's tied up in one big bowtie of a theme... _nihilism_!"

I just don't buy it.

Because the film has a very shallow idea of nihilism. Evelyn only dips into nihilistic territory because she's sad and has given up. She's sick of everyone's shit. Fuck it, let's go die in the black hole.

But that's not a consistent philosophy. Go eat shit and die when you're sad? Philosophy deals with living. Sadness, suffering, failing are all parts of life, and if the resolute answer were "Jump off a building" it would be insufficient to explain the billions of people living now who, frankly, _succeed_ at many things, many known, some unknown.

The film has essentially set up a strawman for Evelyn to defeat. Not unlike the MO of a popular action series, the Fast and the Furious franchise.

You have to really consider that Evelyn learns to reconcile with her daughter and herself because she experienced one of the Fast and the Furious films, but in real life. You know, one of those films where the bad guy is going to nuke someplace somewhere and, to add insult to injury, has kidnapped your baby, so you gotta muster enough individual courage - and a _team_ - to stop them, learning about the value of family at the end.

This film combines a family drama and an action film - because, hey, multiverse - and is less than its parts.

### Multiverse of meaninglessness

The worst part is that the characters have little to no personality.

Don't be fooled by the witticism, none of the characters have agency, a fundamental part of personality. People _choose_ things - they choose activity over passivity, they choose running over rock-climbing, they choose gaming over sewing, they choose burgers over chicken sandwiches. You could argue some of that is determined by that person's material circumstances - financial, biological, parental - but every person everywhere has a choice to leave those circumstances, regardless of the success of the attempt.

Evelyn is forced to save the world. Joy is forced to be a destroyer of universes. Actually, both male leads exercise the most agency - Alpha-Waymond chooses to help Evelyn, while regular Waymond chooses to divorce her. The grandfather chooses to murder the two biggest troublemakers across the multiverse. That dude is awesome.

This is an especially big problem for a film about choice itself.

Evelyn in one universe chooses not to be with Waymond. Evelyn in another universe chooses to be a chef. Evelyn in another universe chooses to be a human billboard.

But... why?

What about her fundamental character made her choose to do any of these things? Is it that they all happened entirely by fate?

This is less of an issue with the film, but with the idea of a multiverse in general. This is why I took the pain of defining it - if you think really deeply about it, the idea makes no sense. It ignores nearly every school of philosophy - it does a number on Confucianism, which believes people can _choose_ to be good, so long as they have someone to model themselves on.

This idea is so flawed that the filmmakers had to scramble to fix the ending: they declared, the multiverse has no rules, true... except that it is bound together by _love_. They _needed_ to do this in order to have any satisfying ending.

If the multiverse was not bound by love, then Evelyn could very easily have decided that not only should she and her daughter kill themselves, but that they should, in an act of benevolence, kill everyone in the black hole of doom in order to save them more misery. If a multiverse can interchange _any_ material circumstances, there are universes where people starve and suffer, where people are struggling to live on a doomed Earth, where people have literally no concept of compassion or good will for one another, where people genuinely do not have a concept of love and only create children out of necessity; in fact, there may even be a multiverse where people straight-up just don't have kids, or asexually reproduce. How convenient for the filmmakers they did not show those.

Millenia of philosophy preceding the film have considered the film's argument far more completely than the film has: that people suffer, that other people may cause that suffering, and, by coming to understand meaning itself, we can make something out of this life in spite of suffering. The film analyzes this in a binary way: live or die. No in-between. It wasn't even novel when Christ came back to life or the Buddha accessed all of the memories of his past lives - around the beginning of language, we have considered that there are other states to inhabit beside suffering and death.

Love was an easy get-out-of-jail card. You don't have to think too hard about it, and it works for the film because the film requires much more emotions out of its audience than thinking. I mean, the multiverse jumping stuff doesn't even make any sense, but it's a great sight gag. As Carrie Fisher said, "It's a film about family, and that's what's so powerful about it." She was speaking about a Disney movie. The film can certainly be described as a better-than-average modern Disney movie.

### Conclusion

I went extra hard on this film because I got annoyed by the critics' over-explanations. The film does not have a coherent philosophy. It's also honestly not a good representation of a Chinese, much less an Asian, family. False beliefs can be dangerous, because they are chosen through emotions rather than reason. So someone has to set the record straight.

However, the film is entertaining. It's pretty funny. It has really good action scenes. It has creativity abounding. I'd recommend one watch, if it comes on streaming services or DVD. Watch it with your family.

But when I left the theater I declared to someone: "I would recommend it to a fan of action but there's not much of an action movie in it." I'm convinced there's no alternate universe where it becomes one, either.
