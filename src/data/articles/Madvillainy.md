It's bizarre how little I've regarded Madvillain's (MF DOOM as MC and Madlib as producer) "Madvillainy". I always believed it was unique, and _good_, but had a huge indifference and almost disdain for it.

Recently, MF DOOM's wife revealed he had died on October 31 of this year. If you had asked me months before if I would care about Daniel Dumile's death, I would have said no. But I was strangely affected for some reason.

One, the announcement was very timely, being on the very last day of a bizarre year. Two, on reflection, the guy was extremely talented and had a distinct voice that no one else had. You can look at Ghostface Killah or Earl Sweatshirt as colleagues, but the guy exceeded them for his weirdness.

In hindsight, I had a mental block that prevented me from fully appreciating MF DOOM's music. I come from a school of thought that art is _about_ something - before you finish your thought, no, I don't mean art is about morals or values or greater themes about humanity, I don't believe in sentimental nonsense like that. I mean, when you make a work of art, you figure out the setting, the characters, the subject, the ideas ahead of time and confine yourself to those, keeping everything tightly wound.

I was waiting for the **great** MF DOOM album, in hindsight. Much in the same way David Bowie threw his entire oeuvre into perspective with the release of "Blackstar", I was waiting for MF DOOM to release the one album that would put all his ideas into a greater context. In fact, I play this - strange - game for many other artists. A Tribe Called Quest nicely summed up their art in "We Got It from Here..."

It was therefore weird hearing the MF DOOM passed away recently. I mean, who cares about celebrity deaths, right? People have died since the beginning of time. I guess I felt I had waited too long.

### The album

I set my mind to listening to "Madvillainy" again, which I had done for years in the hopes of feeling something from the album. In the past I felt it was kinda all over the place and couldn't find a specific thread to latch onto. MF DOOM's lyrics, while technically creative, seemed scattershot, and Madlib's production almost consumed whatever narrative DOOM was attempting throughout the album. Too many instrumental tracks, too many divergences in concept.

When I heard it that last time, it all clicked together for me.

2020 was a good year musically, for me. 2020 as a year made subpar music, in my opinion, but it was the year I finally dove into jazz. I realized great jazz musicians are made in live albums, and great studio albums are made when they capture the chaos of a live performance. **Chaos** is the critical element of jazz music, one that differentiates it from orchestral music. Mozart's music is excellent because the timing and ideas are perfect; Charlie Parker's music is excellent because he constantly innovates around his bandmembers.

For jazz, you just _listen_ - the thrill is in following the various threads between bass, trumpet, piano and drums and then following the combination of these threads together simultaneously. You can't easily frame it within an intellectual framework, in comparison to orchestral music.

"Madvillainy" is the exact same thing. On last listen, the record was obviously influenced by jazz music through Madlib's production; the bigger surprise was that DOOM's lyrics were _also_ conceptually similar to jazz music. He may have an idea of what he wants a song to revolve around, like "Curls" and "Fancy Clown", but he is satisfied keeping the audience's attention with incredible attention to detail in the narrative he is creating and the technical twists and turns his lyrics go through. Just like the bebop standard "Salt Peanuts", sometimes you'll hear a rendition that sucks and another that will drop your jaw - it depends on the specific energy and the performance of the artists at that moment. DOOM is there, living in "Madvillainy", man.

If you want theatrics and narrative, then you're probably better off listening to the Wu-Tang Clan, who, given RZA's comments, actually had a plan for continuity in their records. DOOM and Madlib are only villains because, just like supervillains, they make impossible deeds look easy.

It's probably impossible to listen to "Madvillainy" while surfing the net or otherwise multitasking. Just as MF DOOM conveys to you in "Bistro", it's a record you really have to sit, relax and listen to. Madlib's instrumentals cause lots of shifts in tonal inconsistency - some take over entire tracks, while others consume the entire intro/outro of other tracks. Listen to the whole thing as one long organic piece, relegating DOOM's lyrics to a role of simply another instrument. In hindsight, the record has a similar approach to The Avalanches' "Wildflower"; except, of course, The Avalanches did not have MF DOOM working with them.

### Regret

I didn't think there was much point in writing an article about this until a specific thought occurred to me.

I always thought DOOM was a weird person, more provocateur in his later years than the artist he used to be. (Was I able to prove this? No, because I scarcely listened to his music.) I also felt he was a weird sex pervert (given his lyrics, all things considered). This, followed by my disconnect to his music, made me ignore him.

That's why I feel regret. I'm listening to "Madvillainy" a lot now - in fact, I'm playing it now and planning on playing it again immediately afterwards. I'm the least to know anything about black culture, but it's certainly true, for any person, that people look kindlier upon you after you die.

For obvious reasons I thought a lot about Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus, Miles Davis and Basquiat this year and how _weird_ those guys were and how underappreciated they were during their time. Life is life, right? I mean, who cares. But I feel some regret because it's only after they pass away do we realize what an impact they had on art. And this is no Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen-type regret - both of them had their moment, both of them had their influence. But there are quite a great many musicians, black or otherwise, who contributed to the moments that made you happy, or gave you a relevation, and who go through life with complete indifference. Few can name the people who started techno or inspired your favorite pop or rap artist.

To say something is "bad" or "sad" is to cheapen it. I'm happy just saying it's "weird". It made me feel weird thinking of my complete turnaround with "Madvillainy", which smacked to me of being a bit hypocritical.

Well, I'm here now. I'm going to listen to "Madvillainy" a lot now. (It also had the effect of making me like "Supreme Clientele" a lot, lot more. Gift keeps on giving.)
