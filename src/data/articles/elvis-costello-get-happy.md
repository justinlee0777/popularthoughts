### Elvis Costello is a strange musician

I love Elvis Costello's music. I used to play his first six albums with The Attractions all the time. I can't think of a musician who appeals so much to my sarcastic sense of humor, and as a result is someone I would want to write like.

But Costello's career is _weird_. I think everyone acknowledges he's a great lyricist, but it's hard to make out his output from a musical perspective. Costello up to his 30th birthday, though deeply entrenched in punky/poppy music, at least attained a consistent sound and character. He's been playing around with soul and classical music recently, but it feels like he's _playing_ around, which is a bit insulting to say but sounds somewhat true. Nothing post-30 sounds particularly distinct, though there is material that is great (see: Brutal Youth; When I Was Cruel).

Although, as I say this, one of my favorite, maybe _the_ favorite song, is from this post-30 period: "Don't Look Now" from "Look Now". I always make the joke that men can't write women, and vice versa, though it is quite true: even the literary greats struggled to make the truest portrayals of men and women; I think of Colette's "The Sick Child" and Darya and Katerina from Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina". Costello, very oddly - or, not at all - inhabits almost perfectly the female protagonist of "Don't Look Now". Sure, the woman is only an object of attraction to an unknown man in the song, but the song actually plays upon the idea - she perceives that she is, counterreacts to the thought, and in an admission of love accepts the thought. A full character is spun out in 2 and a half minutes. In hindsight, it's not surprising Costello could write, and sing, as this character: his early career was populated by emasculated men, who inwardly raged at the social idea of manliness. In so doing, he exposed the emotional vulnerability of these aforesaid men and critiqued society at the same time. That same play on vulnerability, on gender, and on personal relationships play out brilliantly on "Don't Look Now" and exist in a somewhat obfuscated manner on the remainder of the album.

It's weird because there are musicians that you wish would just _grow up_, as I feel for Prince or Thurston Moore, but Costello is constructing the best storytelling of his career.

It was only after re-listening to "Get Happy!!", for the umpteenth time, that I realized where my disparity of feeling came from.

### Get Happy!!

"Get Happy!!" is a great album for 20-year-olds to rock out to, which is what I was when I first listened to it. Now I'm wondering if it's his _best_ album.

Let's clarify I don't think it's his best-written album - his later ones are. I believe it was Robert Christgau who said Costello was _too_ clever for his own good - he relied too often on the cleverness of his puns and jokes rather than the substance of what he was singing. As I get a bit older, this does turn out to be true, but it doesn't impact the music all too negatively. In hindsight, that's what makes the charm of his early albums - the colorful, cartoon nature of his music forms an aesthetic, an aesthetic, too, that no other artist has formed. As Costello pitifully croons in "B-Movie": "B-Movie, that's all you're truly / just a soft soap story / Don't want the woman to adore me". All in all, life is one big dumb joke.

We saw the formations of this aesthetic on his debut album, in "Pay It Back":

"Stop, thief, you're going to come to grief, if you don't take a little more care;<br/>
You're gonna get more than the family branch from this one shoestring affair.<br/>

I may be crazy but I can't contemplate<br/>
being trapped between the doctor and the magistrate."

Then progressed it even further in "Armed Forces", especially in the underrated "Two Little Hitlers":

"You call selective dating, for some effective mating;<br/>
I thought I'd let you down dear, but you were just a flame -<br/>
I knew right from the start, we'd end up hating -<br/>

Pictures of the merchandise plastered on the wall,<br/>
We can look so long as we don't have to talk at all."

"Trust" and "Imperial Bedroom" would focus more on the human drama, beginning the fascination of his later career. (This review actually began with me listening to Bedroom's "...And In Every Home": "You turn to the sinister, when you get the boot / Sliding down the bannister in your Sunday suit.")

"Get Happy!!" is the culmination of this cartoony, satirical aesthetic. It begins with the visual rollercoaster, "Love for Tender":

"You won't take my love for tender;<br/>
You can put your money where your mouth is, but you're so unsure.<br/>
I can be an advisor, or a big spender,<br/>
but you might get much more than you bargained for."

To be honest, this song is so full of puns that when I first listened to it, I actually didn't catch what he was directly singing about, though I got the gist. In here is not an Angry Costello, as was seen in "This Year's Model", nor the Satirical Costello, as in "Armed Forces", but a Costello that, frankly, I haven't seen since...a _Funny_ Costello.

As in my favorite verse from "Opportunity":

"I'm in the foxhole, I'm down in the trench,<br/>
I'd be a hero but I can't stand the stench.<br/>

The Fitness Institute was full of General Motormen<br/>
and the "Hello House of Beauty" wouldn't stand a chance with them -<br/>

The chairman of this boredom is a compliment collector;<br/>
I'd like to be his funeral director."

Here is the _easiest_ music he's made, he sounds so relaxed here as he bumbles through each eye-rolling situation until, at the last, he impotently rages at a superior.

"Easy" is the key word in "Get Happy!!" While one couldn't call it a completely coherent album, its main power lies in identifying the various embarassments and absurdities of social situations.

"King Horse":

"Cheap cut satin and cheap perfume,<br/>
Showtime is almost here;<br/>
Teased up by a strip cartoon,<br/>
Laughing up your sleeve,<br/>
Sniggering in your beer..."

And the chorus: "Now I know that you're all King Horse / Between tenderness and brute force."

"Clowntime is Over":

"Almost too good to be true -<br/>
Who do you? Why do you? What do you do?<br/>
Everybody's hiding under covers;<br/>
Who's making lovers' lane,<br/>
Safe again for lovers?"

Later on, you have the famous cover of "I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down", where he whines "Simple though love is / Still it confuses me / Why I'm not loved the way I should be? / Now I've lived with heartaches / and I've roomed with fear / I've dealt with despair / and I've wrestled with tears."

For someone who couldn't be called the most subtle musician, his construction of this absurd world occurs quite subtly while you're dancing to these pop songs. Even in the slowest, least groovy song, "Motel Matches", he's still cracking wise: "Falling for you without a second look / Falling out of your open pocketbook / Giving you away like motel matches."

It's simultaneously his most accessible and most consistent work up-to-date. I was puzzled for a long time by Elvis Costello, because he reminded me a lot of the, almost deified, Leonard Cohen, who also employed quite a bit of sarcasm and anger in his music, though Costello hasn't written something equal to "I'm Your Man". "Get Happy!!" solved the puzzle; in a way, as bitter and seething "I'm Your Man" can be, Cohen remains relaxed and all-knowing throughout it, inhabiting a single, world-weary voice capable of observing the pitiful nature of life. (One of my favorite lines ever, in "Tower of Song": "I said to Hank Williams, How lonely does it get / Hank Williams hasn't answered me yet / But I hear him coughing, all night long.") "Get Happy!!", similarly, is easy to sink into because, as bitter as Costello is, he is inwardly laughing off every trouble he encounters, being a regular part of the stupidity of life. Here, the duality of the music embraces drama and comedy together; in his subsequent albums, he largely succumbs to the drama.

That must be the reason why I like "Don't Look Now" and "Brutal Youth" so much - it has that depth of at once creating a character, having a sense of humor over itself and being sharply perceptive of the situation it inhabits. With even more hindsight, it's also the reason why Steely Dan's "Gaucho" seems to be the best Elvis Costello album Costello never wrote - everything about it is sharpened to the point of perfection, from its viciousness, its musicality, and its rendering of a hipster hell.

On the last track of "Get Happy!!", "Riot Act" finally gives our sarcastic singer a human element:

"Why do you talk such stupid nonsense?<br/>
when my mind could rest much easier;<br/>
instead of all this dumb-dumb insolence<br/>
I would be happier with amnesia.<br/>
...<br/>
Trying to be so bad is bad enough,<br/>
don't make me love by talking tough;<br/>
don't put your heart out on your sleeve<br/>
when your remarks are off the cuff."

Much should be said about Costello's performance on track, which can be described as "eviscerated". As clever as our protagonist is to still resort to puns, he is genuinely wounded and almost devolves ("dumb-dumb insolence", "trying to be so bad is bad enough", "don't make me love by talking tough", all of them stock phrases). The facade crumbles - as it would again in Imperial Bedroom's "Kid about It" - and, honestly, it would have been interesting if, dividing the album into fourths, this transitioned into a new theme in the last fourth of the album.

Not that we could expect this - throughout his career Costello has never cared much for the idea of the concept album, though one wonders if he has almost unconsciously approached it here. It's strange that he evidently hasn't, because he's an able storyteller and writer of characters. Bob Dylan wrote "Blood on the Tracks" and Joni Mitchell wrote "Court and Spark", so why couldn't he write a song cycle?

I'm sure Costello fans could spend days thinking of what a concept album would look like - I'll venture my version, even if incomplete. Given his interest in politics and social drama, and his colorful writing style and his sense of humor, I'd like to see a concept album revolving around a retired politician (retiring at the "early" age of 60 or so, Costello's age), reflecting on his career and confronting the tedium of his remaining life, his milquetoast wife, his amount-to-nothing kids, and the sudden about-face of everyone in his social circle. I'd like there to be no explicit plot - there may be actions he undertakes in individual songs, but I would like the music to be about _him_, the emotional and intellectual profile of that character. And you know what, I don't care if the music is danceable. He can hang out with the Imposters or the Sugarcanes - he can make it sound like "Man out of Time", "Under Lime", "This is Hell", "New Lace Sleeves" or even "No Action" (but wouldn't it be _so funny_ if he wrote a song sounding like "No Action"?). I just like watching him make music, at this point.
