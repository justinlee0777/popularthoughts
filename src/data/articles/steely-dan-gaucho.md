I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### Steely Dan's Gaucho

I whistle the intro to "Gaucho", really Keith Jarrett's "'Long As You Know You're Living Yours", but enhanced 100 times better with the sax, all the time. Literally. As I walk the exhausting path from Bryant Park up to Central Park, I am humming, imitating the sax as best as I can. It makes me happy, and it makes me feel life is bearable, even when the protagonists of the song do not think so.

This is one of my favorite songs ever. It's really funny, and what's incredible is that you can laugh at the song and you can take the song seriously.

All of Steely Dan's album "Gaucho" is like this. "Hey Nineteen" is sung from the perspective of a creeper creeping on the nineteen year olds who moved in next door. "Glamour Profession" may be a dig on Magic Johnson. "Time Out Of Mind" is about how great getting high is. Steely Dan is always mocking the heroes of their songs, but there's a real attempt at trying to understand them. They see some of themselves in the refrain of "My Rival", "I was the whining stranger, / a fool in love, with time to kill". In "Hey Nineteen"? "Hey nineteen, that's 'rethra Franklin, / She don't remember the Queen of Soul, / Hard times have fallen on Soul Survivors, / She thinks I'm crazy, but I'm just growing old". Ouch. Me too, Walt, Donald, me too. This may actually be my favorite album of 1980.

That horn. That fucking horn. Changing Jarrett's soothing piano to a passionate sax is a genius move. One, it feels like the opening to a sitcom, because, two, it makes the listener relax. After the dripping sarcasm of "Glamour Profession" ("One on one, he's schoolyard Superman, / crashing the backboard, he's Jungle Jim" are fucking mean lyrics for American writers), it's nice for the band to not be too jaded of wise asses.

And it's lovely that Dan begins _in media res_: "Just when I say, 'Boy, we can't miss, / you are golden', then you do this," establishing neatly in two lines what seems to be a talent and his agent. Then the first laugh of the song: "You say this guy is so cool, / snapping his fingers like a fool." I have no idea what's really happening in the lines, but I can _imagine_ it, this dude's lover acting like an idiot and him grinning like a fool. The next few lines show some darkness to the relationship: "One more expensive kiss-off, / who do you think I am?" suggesting there's a bit of fixing going on here.

The pre-chorus:

Lord, I know you're a special friend,<br/>
but you don't seem to understand;<br/>
we got heavy rollers, I think you should know,<br/>
try again tomorrow.

This is where Dan's meticulousness comes in, so much so that only a [drum machine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaucho_(album)#Drum_recording>) could fulfill their specific beat pattern. The guitar flutters after "friend", as if the singer is sighing, and the instruments pause after "but you" and resume heavier in "don't seem to understand", an even deeper, more melancholic sigh. "Heavy rollers" demands a cymbal crash as if to emphasize the seriousness of the situation, and the piano outros for "try again tomorrow", looking forward to a brighter future.

Which doesn't come. I'm not sure what Donald Fagen's mentality was for this track, but his "Can't you see their laughing at me?" is so full of desperation and yet _so funny_. "Get rid of him! / I don't care what you do at home." The song begins the chorus with "Would you care to explain?..."

Who is the gaucho, 'migo?<br/>
Why is he standing<br/>
in your spangled leather poncho<br/>
and your elevator shoes?<br/>
Bodacious cowboys,<br/>
such as your friend,<br/>
will never be welcome here,<br/>
high in the Custerdome!

The Custerdome, by the way, [is not real](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteelyDan/comments/r84k54/high_in_the_fictional_custerdome/).

This is usually when the song gets my first audible chuckle. The escalation is so funny. The detail of the "spangled leather poncho", the pause, and _then_ the mention of elevator shoes is too great. The Greek chorus singing, too, "Bodacious cowboys" is meant to ridicule the eponymous "Gaucho", but it also dramatizes this character, we can see the absurdity of his existence in front of our eyes. The best part about this chorus is that it works at once to highlight the drama in the song, but it works equally as well as dialogue. You can see the manager screaming that last argument out, "Bodacious cowboys, / such as your friend, / will never be welcome here, / high in the Custerdome!" which is a _ridiculous_ thing to say, more detail than there needs to be, but it works for the character.

One of the strengths of the verses is that they don't fit regular rhyming scheme. You can see very clearly the measure of each line is off by the length of the lines above. Dan somehow makes this work wonders with the jazzy setup. The song still sounds like a _song_, something melodic and keeping with the beat. The singers simply linger on words, as "standing" becomes "sta-anding", "elevator" becomes "ell-levator". It contributes to the relaxed nature of the song but it also depicts our singer emphasizing each word to dramatic effect, as if the extra enunciation will get facts into his charge's skull.

The second verse, as fits the jazzy theme of the song, is a modulation of the first, so I won't go over much of it. I do bust a gut at these lines:

No, he can't sleep on the floor,<br/>
What do you think I'm yelling for?

Fagen cries, softly so as not to deviate too much from the song, but with palpable agony.

Then, the other gut-busting lines:

I'll drop him near the freeway,<br/>
doesn't he have a home?

I just love the frustration and bewilderment in his voice.

For sure there's a darkness to this song. I don't think any of these lines imply death, but there's a fair bit of psychological manipulation on our singer's part. But we laugh anyway. There's something impenetrable about the song, that we look at the events of the song from the outside instead of, as is typical for music, the inside. I think the song is so well-arranged that, from the intro, you are transported into an impossible world, one of so much ease and luxury, that we look onto this man-made heaven with wonder and no empathy. It's funny how jazz can transport people into new worlds, but Dan made this world just for looking, not for interacting or being.

I mention too that the song plays like a sitcom, but... it also feels real. That's the fascinating part. We know a sitcom is not real, but there's something so convincing in Fagen's voice that we gleam these emotions, these intentions do in fact exist in people, outside of our own lives. Who knows? Perhaps if we analyze our own lives, we find some situations where we sound like these sad sacks.

No wonder I'm always in love with this song. It appeals to my sense of cynicism, and yet it also appeals to my sense of humor, as if humor can make cruelty look forgivable. Perhaps we can feel something like wonder and amusement, rather than hatred and envy, for these very, very wealthy folks who create their own trouble. Perhaps.
