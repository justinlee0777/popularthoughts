You can't spell "Darkest Dungeon" without RNG.

Let me get another sentence in before you leave the room.

RNG's issue does not lie with its existing in the first place, the somewhat-silly "skill" vs. "no-skill" debate. People have been happy with randomness in games for a while - I mean, how is it that Monopoly sells so many units? (Besides being bought by tourists.) The real issue lies with the concept of "fairness" - as in, do I deserve this particular outcome, which I have little control over? That's probably one of the greatest philosophical questions in gaming in general.

I'm happy with the RNG allocating quirks (which are negative traits that can be forced on characters). I'm happy with the RNG dictating random encounters, with the Collector, for example (I was pleased to evacuate a dungeon where I was forced to face him/her/it). I'm happy with the RNG determining dungeon layout and loot.

The dodging and critical hit rates are maddening as hell and can seriously impact a "good" player of "Darkest Dungeon". I suppose a "good" player is someone who can easily manage risk, prepare effective teams and garner a net gain from each dungeon over the costs of running one. But everyone is absolutely screwed by the dice roll when it comes to the number of times an enemy can dodge and the number of times they get in a critical hit, which can literally end well-planned dungeon runs over _nothing_. The player is prevented, or delayed, from experiencing more of the game's content because of RNG. No amount of preparation can stop it: enemies eventually get absurd levels of the dodge and crit stat.

This is where it stops being about the concept of fairness and whether the player can accept that they will be screwed every once in a while. Again: this is a substantial difference from being screwed in an out-of-game event (as the game is _designed_ around combat encounters, as the most stress/loot comes from them). Shrieker's Prize is a welcomed out-of-game event.

For example, the hamlet could experience a massacre and require all of the Vestals - the game's best healers - in your party to bless the dead. You can't bring any healers next dungeon, but they all gain one resolve level when your party returns back to town.

To emphasize, *I made that up*. There are few scenarios, where the player is put into a bad-or-worse decision, like this.

Bad luck is interesting if there is an in-canon explanation for it. "Dungeons & Dragons" is the best example where a natural 1 is a source of many great adventuring anecdotes. There is no good explanation for the dodges and crits in "Darkest Dungeon" except that the computer is screwing with the player. Worse, this is combined with genuine enemy intelligence, where enemy parties will dog-pile and attempt to kill one character _when they have never tried to do so before_. So, yes, the game is sometimes unfair _for no reason_.

The contradiction is that the heroes given to the players are nearly superhuman. Either empower the player or don't.

Beyond the combat, which, to reiterate, is the most dominant aspect of the game, the dungeoneering is lackluster. There's not much variation to dungeons and savvy players can min-max their loot fairly easily. There are pretty clear rules for how many torches, food and shovels to bring for the varying dungeon settings.

The _idea_ of the game is probably the most appealing part. The aesthetic is genuinely neat. The various dungeon environments and their accompanying horde of monsters are all unique and interesting. The bosses are really cool and have interesting designs. As heroes, the Abomination and the Leper are conceptually fascinating. With such interesting ideas building up the universe of the game, really all the actual game has to be is _passably_ good, which it is. But for that same reason, I'd never attempt the game again beyond a first playthrough. To paraphrase Joe Rogan, there's no reward for braving dark dungeons - it's just hard; it's a trick, and you get tricked into doing tough shit.

...Now, I would say I would never try "Darkest Dungeon 2", but the vibe I get from the game, without looking at the pre-release, is that the plot is similar to that of "Diablo 2". Which is an exciting idea.
