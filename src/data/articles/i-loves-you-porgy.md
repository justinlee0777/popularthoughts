I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### Nina Simone's I Loves You, Porgy

Before the [original, dramatic version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Panv8OJjgHk&pp=ygUcaSBsb3ZlcyB5b3UgcG9yZ3kgYW5uZSBicm93bg%3D%3D), before [Ella's soaring, amorous version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W65c2Dj1lk&pp=ygUhZWxsYSBmaXR6Z2VyYWxkIGkgbG92ZXMgeW91IHBvcmd5), before [Billie's smoky, lingering version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26HSGMUh-3U&pp=ygUgaSBsb3ZlcyB5b3UgcG9yZ3kgYmlsbGllIGhvbGlkYXk%3D) (and, upon research, after [Whitney's sparkling version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyzTQOBAzI4&pp=ygUgaSBsb3ZlcyB5b3UgcG9yZ3kgcG9yZ3kgYW5kIGJlc3M%3D)), there was Nina Simone's extremely melancholy version of "I Loves You, Porgy" from her 1964 live album "Nina Simone In Concert". This was even before I knew of the opera's existence; this would be my first listen of Simone.

I've already [talked about the controversial opera, "Porgy and Bess"](/porgy-and-bess), which Nina may have, rightfully, after her initial success, criticized. My opinion will be shallow to some: my God there are beautiful songs in it, and I think, while it is fair game to judge, it should be seen before it is judged, because I don't believe it's as unflattering as people think it is, in spite of the librettist's, DuBose Heyward's, insistence on the lyrics being in "dialect" (I'm no linguist to make a judgment of my own).

What strikes me in this listen is how short Nina's version is. Ella's "I Wants To Stay Here" is 4 and a half minutes long; Nina's is 2 and a half, all the more notable when she packs so much indecision, caution and fear in the first few seconds of the song, in her voice and in the piano-playing.

She begins plaintively enough, "I love you, Porgy; don't let him take me," giving immense pathos to the "me" which she lingers on. The "don't" is elongated, out of despair. "Don't let him handle me, and drive me mad. If you can keep me..." (where the wandering piano audibly pauses, as if unsure whether such speculation is even possible), "I want to stay here, with you, forever, and I'll be so glad."

One of the things that struck me all those years ago was the psychological intensity behind the lyrics. Most artists sing of the heights and whimsies of love, but few have enough honesty to describe this kind of flight as violent. Nina's voice, sad now, forebodes the violence of passion, and she knows precisely where it comes from: our flaws as human beings, and our inability to overcome them. That "don't let him handle me, and drive me mad" is a particularly poignant line, the thoughts of an animal who has recovered from their wounds but fears reprisal, not due to any fate or sense of karmic justice but out of knowledge of the cruelty of the world. Then that soul-crushing, emotional line: "I want to stay here, with you, forever, and I'll be so glad," which demonstrates the character's knowing what is right and good and true, but is unsure of her own power to pursue; indeed, she feels she shouldn't have it, out of self-deprecation.

This is an incredible interpretation, that is not entirely present in Gershwin's original. The lyrics are all there, but the _feeling_ comes from Nina's precise arrangements - the blue piano, demonstrating Nina's influence by Bach, whose expressive ability influenced a great deal of jazz musicians - and the timing of her vocal delivery. Every other cover is a _song_, whose lyrics are delivered to a beat. Nina's is a _monologue_. She doesn't emphasize the lyrics' qualities as music, but as rhetoric. Which makes it hit so much harder, for Gershwin had a knack for writing lyrics in idiomatic language.

The strings and drums quieten entirely, as Simone contemplates:

Someday I know he's coming back, to call on me...<br/>
he's going to handle me and hold me so...<br/>
it's going to be like dying, Porgy, daddy, deep inside me...<br/>
but when he comes, I know - I'll have to go.

"Someday" is sung with such brightness you wouldn't think it illuminates an agonizing future. Then there's Nina's delicate handling of "handle me and hold me so"; there's something about the pauses she places here, absent in other covers, where you see her being treated like a doll. Finally, there's the "but when he comes, I know" - she lingers here so long it feels like a wail, lingers here so long you can almost hear the phlegm and spittle in her voice evoked from fear. All this to start again with: "I love you, Porgy", the reiteration of this character's sole hope.

The song's ending, "If you can keep me, / I want to stay here, / with you, forever, / 'cause I've got my man," is meant to be the sound of triumph, but in Simone's hands it's a sign of faithfulness. Not that this interpretation is lacking in other covers, but you can see they come largely from feelings of love. This is an appeal to reason; this is asking one's self, one's sense of goodness and perhaps one's sense of a greater power in the universe, to come to one's senses, end the madness, and begin doing things one knows is good for them. In a sense, "Dear God, please don't let me fuck up again." No wonder I thought the song was longer than its 2 and a half minute frame; the fears and anxieties exhibited in it are as long as life itself.

It's worth noting that, in the original, Porgy does respond to Bess to allay her fears. Porgy is the Biblical hero of the story, a son of Jesse fighting Goliath, so we take his word. His omission here - and in Holliday's cover - is an inspired artistic decision.

As I reflect on the opera now, it's interesting how some of the songs have taken a life of their own outside of Gershwin's original interpretation. Besides the various takes on "I Loves You, Porgy", there's Louis and Ella's "Porgy and Bess". Take their menacing cover of "Summertime", which, like the season itself, can on a hairpin turn from great pleasure into violence. For all the criticism on Gershwin's "lampblack Negroism", the opera has become a songbook where innovation, from black artists primarily, improves the interpretation and enjoyment of the original text. This is exactly what Simone did for this song. As you recall, I didn't know the opera existed when I first heard it. At all. It would only be much, much later when I heard the booming original and Louis and Ella's swinging version. The darkness and piety of this version, this live version that appeared exactly with the release of "Mississippi Goddamn", influenced by the assassination of activist Medgar Evers and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, has haunted me for so many years. And, also gave a lot of hope for me, as brought upon by the gentle prayer at song's end. After all these years, the song is completely hers.
