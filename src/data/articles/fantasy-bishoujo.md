The premise of "Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout" is that two childhood friends, male, age 32, are transported into another world, one of them turned into a woman. And they are placed under a spell making them fall in love with each other.

I am kicking myself for not thinking of this premise.

### On isekai

_Isekai_ anime are an unusual bunch. The word translates literally into English as "different world". A while back, I did a sampler of _isekai_ - I would watch one random episode for each of the 25 _isekai_ I had listed. Here is the general conclusion:

1. A show is good when one of the themes of the _isekai_ is about newness, seeing new things, learning new things, being accustomed to new things. A dramatic show, like "Overlord", "Log Horizon" and "The Saga of Tanya the Evil" is about understanding the new world the character is in and trying to find stability in it. More traditional, story-focused anime like "Fushigi Yugi", "Vision of Escaflowne", and "Now and Then, Here and Now" are in the same vein, but the main character is usually trying to leave the violent world. Even shows like "Restaurant to Another World" or "The Devil is a Part-Timer", which do not take place in outlandish situations, are about the characters trying to adjust to a new, extreme change in their routine, which causes comedy.

2. A show is bad - very, very bad - when the _isekai_ nature of the show is just for wish fulfillment, in that the audience wants to go into another world simply because they hate their own life or find this one boring. This is the type that fills the lists every season, nowadays. This season "Arifureta" is being published, last season it was "Mushoku Tensei", the season before that was "Reincarnated as a Slime" or whatever and before that it was something else. There are also lots of gimmick anime, such as that one anime last season about a girl who was overleveled or something, and then there's the infamous show about going into another world with your mother.

Notice how in these shows there's very little _new_ that's going on. The shows expect the audience to know a bit about fantasy conventions, and rather than do something interesting with that, they just say "...and you have a smartphone." If the anime made the main characters feel uncomfortable with their setting, to the point of anxiety, then the audience feels that same anxiety. No, characters can only feel anxiety coming from interpersonal relationships, as those can be easily resolved by the end of the episode, or by beating the bad guy.

Again, these types of shows are just for the audience, not for the audience's curiosity. The main reason why one would want to write an _isekai_ is to explore that environment of anxiety, of uncertainty, but also of opportunity. A modern _isekai_ like "Shield Hero" pulls it off quite well, while retaining the elements of wish fulfillment. Instead of satisfying his taste for women or for wealth, Naofumi is actually using the opportunity to adventure and meet new people, but ultimately he wants to leave (probably because the world has traumatized him, and is trying to kill him).

### It's a brilliant premise

In that context the premise of "Life..." is brilliant. It may even be genius. I certainly wish I thought of it.

A friend and I get a lot of joy out of reading the descriptions of seasonal anime. We really are like kids in a candy store, when we open up a list a week before the anime are released, because the descriptions are absolutely ridiculous. I really cannot tell what goes on in those corporate meetings where projects are deliberated, but most, if not all, of the anime are just really sad, really transparent.

When we got to "Life..." I laughed, not because it was sad, but because the description actually sounded perfect. I remember saying, "I mean, the show is going to suck, but if you think about it this show works perfectly, right?

"The whole conflict of the story is, they're best friends and they're trying not to fuck each other. And they're both dudes."

I'm laughing just thinking about it. I'm going to be clear and say it's not funny because of the homoerotic implications; it's really funny because of how awkward the situation is. Part of what makes comedy work is that people are complex and encompass many motivations, many feelings - it's funny when these feelings clash, especially when the littleness of the people conflict with the magnitude of the situation.

The fact that it's set up as a romantic comedy - childhood friends, alone together in a new world, both attractive - and the fact that they are aware that it's set up in this way, but also that they've spent _20 years_ with one another as _men_, that is just perfect.

The show pretty much puts the _isekai_ concept on its head. Rather than try to be a subversion of the fantasy genre or the typical adventure story, the _isekai_ element is merely a metaphor for this extremely awkward situation that has happened. In fact, the two characters, Tachibana and Jinguuji, are almost entirely indifferent to the fantasy world. The world itself isn't new; Jinguuji perfectly adapts to the situation becaue of his naturally high intelligence. The world is really a distraction from the realization that they are falling in love with each other.

It's so hard to emphasize how genius the premise is. People have been attempting this kind of idea since "Konosuba": the idea of an "adventure" gone wrong. But they've all lacked a certain creativity, a certain psychological depth.

Take "Konosuba", which has been compared to "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia", in personal conversation. The characters are basically cartoons. Of course they'd have mishaps, because they're completely detached from reality. (The most grounded character, oddly, is Megumin.) In contrast to "Always Sunny", the specific egos - and it's their egos precisely in the way - operating against, with each other is what causes the fundamental conflict in the show. Art requires specificity. Yes, it's funny if *X* strange thing happens in the adventure, but that thing has to carry the whole story, otherwise it mimics a regular fantasy adventure in all but one.

The set-up for "Life..." absolutely holds the entire story up, because it _is_ the entire story. There's no more story after that! "How do these characters escape this fantasy world without fucking each other, thereby causing a lifetime of trauma?" If the purpose of a story is to present the audience a question, then this is the one question I desperately want answered.

This show is the best show I've seen in a while (not counting more renown shows like "Attack on Titan" and "Jojo") and it may even be the best _isekai_ I've ever seen, because it actually does something interesting with the one-person-two-worlds concept. It's one of the best comedies I've seen since "Hinamatsuri". I cheated and read a little of the manga, and my fear is that the show eventually forgets that Tachibana is a man. If that happens, you'll hear it from me; but for now, I'm strapped in for one fantastic ride.
