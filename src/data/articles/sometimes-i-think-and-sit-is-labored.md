Courtney Barnett's "Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit" on its surface feels like an album I should love. First, I love the album title - almost several times a day I think, "That album title describes exactly what my lifestyle is."

Then there's the first passage of "Elevator Operator":

Oliver Paul,<br/>
20 years old,<br/>
Thick head of hair, worried he's going bald,<br/>
Wakes up at a quarter past 9,<br/>
Fare evades his way down the 96-tram line;<br/>

Breakfast on the run again, he's well aware<br/>
he's dropping soy linseed, Vegemite crumbs everywhere.

It's darn good piece of songwriting, maybe even poetry. The strength of poetry is measured by its immediacy and the elegance of its ideas. Already Barnett in the first 7 lines establishes an image of youth and anxiety, and has characterized this fictitious person with a kind of awkwardness, an unfinished nature.

I was reminded immediately of the writing of another musician I dearly love: Elvis Costelo, whom I wrote a <a href="https://weebforce.com/elvis-costello-get-happy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review</a> for "Get Happy!!" In Costello's music, there is an ease for writing stories and painting scenes quickly, and a tendency for self-deprecation and shoulder-shrugging.

Unfortunately, in that same vein, Barnett falls prey to a weakness Costello has.

One of my favorite criticisms of Costello comes from Robert Christgau. From his <a href="https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1851&name=Elvis+Costello+and+the+Attractions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consumer Guide</a>:

> I admit it--I love the lyric sheet. Helps me pay attention, though not always, and persuades me absolutely that "The Long Honeymoon" and "Kid About It" are as great as songwriting ever gets. But it also shores up my impression that he can be precious lyrically, vocally, and musically, and gnomic for no reason at all--in short, pretentious. And while I'm glad he's got soul, too often he invests emotion in turns of phrase he should play cool.

To me, this basically boils down to: The artist is too clever for their own good. In the aforementioned "Get Happy!!" review, I said this was counterbalanced by Costello forming a cartoon aesthetic in his early music - he is deliberately warping and contorting his subjects, and observing how much humanity he can still wring out of them. I don't think Barnett's music has that defense.

The next lines of "Elevator Operator" sunk my heart.

Feelin' sick at the sight of his computer<br/>
He dodges his way through the Swanson commuters,<br/>
Rips off his tie, hands it to a homeless man<br/>
Sleepin' in the corner of a Metro bus stand, he screams<br/>
"I'm not goin' to work today;<br/>
Gonna count the minutes that the trains are late,<br/>
Sit on the grass, building pyramids out of Coke cans."

And just like that, she loses whatever intrigue she had previously built in the scene. In writing, one can't give away the character's arc until, duh, at the end, which she does here, having her character make a life-changing decision by the 30-second mark. Already Oliver Paul has made up his mind and there is no form to his subsequent actions, and therefore nothing for the listener to latch onto; and his life change isn't particularly interesting, only that he suddenly no longer wants to continue what is presumably his job.

I could cover the other details of "Elevator Operator", such as the woman who is enamored with Oliver's skin, but these ideas are less interesting than the first ones; furthermore, the music becomes some kind of pretentious statement on daily life.

"Pedestrian At Best", for this same reason, is also dull to listen too, with the exception that _nothing_ in the song stands out besides the detail Barnett puts into her lyrics. The skill she puts into individual lines is impressive, but the lines do not strengthen, support each other to paint a greater impression. By this point in "Get Happy!!", in the second track, Costello is painting the portrait of a sleazeball who, after a number of escapades, lands into his personal hell of desk work and kiss-asses. In comparison, the diaristic nature of "Pedestrian At Best" seems indulgent, at best.

"An Illustration of Loneliness (Sleepless in New York)" is a pretty good song, however -

I lay awake at four,<br/>
Staring at the wall,<br/>
Counting all the cracks backwards in my best French;<br/>
Reminds me of a book<br/>
I skim-read in a surgery,<br/>
All about palmistry, I wonder what's in store for me;

but then the song does not progress in any sense, dwelling in its enervation.

I think Barnett gets the broad idea right - we understand her sense of humor and her storyteller's sense, and her general feeling of millenial boredom and dread, but the precision and details aren't there. Maybe I'm too much of a Costello fan, but I'll be damned if he didn't get his lyrics right regardless of the arc of his career. If you're telling an anecdote, you're also emphasizing a specific idea in that anecdote, not _just_ how funny it was or how weird. One anecdote is roughly one verse; each successive anecdote progesses the idea of the previous one. Hell, not just Costello, in recent years <a href="https://weebforce.com/waxahatchee-out-in-the-storm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waxahatchee</a> also achieved this.

I dunno, this one's a stinker. But the album coming this year might be good.
