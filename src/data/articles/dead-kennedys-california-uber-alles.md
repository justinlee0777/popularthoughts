I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### Dead Kennedys' California Über Alles

There's probably a song more appropriate for these weird times in US politics, but this song came to mind because presidential hopeful Kamala Harris is from California. Also, Robert Kennedy. Perhaps "Dare To Be Stupid" would have been better, or Elvis Costello's "Man Out Of Time", but we can't write about Elvis Costello every day, can we? (That's not rhetorical; I probably _could_, but I don't know if I _should_.)

In a way though "California Über Alles" is appropriate because Biafra's paranoia is ever present. It's not necessarily about a Californian hippie state; the Kennedys reworked the song [for Reagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDWHIRkFL-8) and [Schwarzenegger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_b-sC9XmCg). As the 2024 election looms into view, voters will effectively have two candidates who live in their own unreality as to how America _should_ be over what it _can_ be. For those traumatized, you have only your political party of choice for repeating 2016. Me, [I voted for Kodos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTABEQ4Qh5Y).

I'm enjoying the ride. I'm smiling at the inanity. I'm vaguely aware all elections are like this. However, we used to have funnier music about it. There's ["The Wit & Wisdom Of Ronald Reagan"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7EZY9cxEj4). There's ["Political Song for Michael Jackson to Sing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxjEi4tgvU0). Then there's [Reagan Youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEhQb8LddEY). There certainly was a cartoony quality to the music of the '80s, elevating the misery and suffering of the times to orgiastic levels. Which makes it still listenable to this day. The exaggeration is nice as you can have your freak-out that this is the end of times, and then at the end of the song you can say "OK, it's not THAT bad."

No one laughed harder than the Kennedys. Their debut album, "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables", is notable for its frothing frenzy even _compared to its hardcore contemporaries_. Part of the madness behind the Kennedys comes from frontman Jello Biafra, who sings every song in a weird surf-rock yodel. He is so excited to sing about genocide in Cambodia. How do you react to unimaginable misery and suffering? You either recoil from it, which is to buckle to the terror, or you admit to the inhumanity and expose it. This is the same meanspirited smirk Voltaire took when writing "Candide".

I mean, "Kill the Poor" suggests we get rid of poverty by throwing an atom bomb at the poor. Biafra suggests in "When Ya Get Drafted": "The economy is looking bad, / let's start another war, / fan the fires of racist hatred, / we want total war." In the aforementioned "Holiday in Cambodia", in the forefront of a menacing surfer riff, "So you've been to school for a year or two, / and you know you've seen it all / in daddy's car, thinking you'll go far, / but back East, your type don't crawl"; at the end, Biafra is literally chanting Pol Pot's name. In other songs, Biafra embraces the cartoonish dimensions of his gremlin character. "Chemical Warfare", he's throwing mustard gas at hoity-toity golfers. "I Kill Children"... well, don't know if there's much more to say than the lyrics. Biafra murmurs, "God told me to skin you alive," before yelping "I kill children, I love to see them die." If you question his sincerity, he follows up with "I kill children, and make their mammas cry."

Are the Kennedys stupid? Sure. But it's a kind of reactive stupidity. Confronted with the dumbness of humanity, the Kennedys promise to journey to new frontiers and go dumberer.

"California Über Alles" is my favorite of the Kennedys' songs. The first half is Biafra's unhinged character rant on former California governor Jerry Brown, and the second is his Third Reich utopia where hippies rule. It's a weird mix of satire and science fiction.

And if you've never heard the song and am wondering if there's any subtlety to the song, Biafra literally begins with "I am governor Jerry Brown, / my army smiles and never frowns." with a marching drum track. No one ever accused the Kennedys of being subtle.

By the way, that line, "Soon I will be president"? Gavin has as much of a chance as Jerry. It's interesting how the California governors have consistently been depicted as political messiahs. (Hot take: California is really not that important in the grander scope of America.)

Carter power will soon go away,<br/>
I will be Führer someday,<br/>
I will command all of you,<br/>
Your kids will meditate in school,<br/>
Your kids will meditate in school!

where Biafra now enters a frothing, frantic scream:

California, über alles, (California, above all,)<br/>
California über alles! (California above all!)<br/>
Über alles, California, (Above all, California,)<br/>
Über alles California! (Above all California!)

My favorite part of the chorus is that when the comma-separated "California" and "über alles" are sung, the guitar (East Bay Ray), bass (Klaus Flouride), and drums (Ted) completely halt, allowing Biafra to finish the words. When Biafra sings the words without the comma, they go from 0 to 100, storming the listener's ears as if willing to power their desire to make California a fascist dictatorship. Biafra in particular is shrieking like a banshee at this part.

Zen fascists will control you,<br/>
One-hundred percent natural,<br/>
You will jog for the master race<br/>
And always wear the happy face.<br/>
Close your eyes, can't happen here,<br/>
Big Bro on white horse is near,<br/>
The hippies won't come back, you say,<br/>
Mellow out or you will pay.

For anyone familiar with Nazi literature, lines 5 and 7 were expressions of disbelief to the Nazis' rise to power and politics at the time. And, well, if you're familiar with Whole Foods and Erewhon, you know what line 2 means.

The third verse. The guitar stops rocking and largely purrs, musically depicting Biafra's SS sneaking in the shadows.

Now it is 1984,<br/>
KNOCK, KNOCK, at your front door,<br/>
It's the suede denim secret police,<br/>
They've come for your uncool niece!<br/>
Come quietly to the camp,<br/>
You'd look nice as a drawstring lamp,<br/>
Don't you worry, it's only a shower,<br/>
For your clothes, here's a pretty flower!

The "KNOCK, KNOCK" has such a sharp onset that Biafra seems to be pronouncing it "ny-au-ck" rather than the (possibly Northeastern) "ny-ou-ck". This works great for depicting the bloody knuckles of Biafra's secret police. The "You'd look nice as a drawstring lamp", well, [the Kochs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampshades_made_from_human_skin) were said to be fond of lamps, let's just say. And as to the showers - huh, do you not know much about the Nazis? maybe it's just me who's morbid - that's [where they gassed their victims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp#Gassings), and the flower is a replacement for [the Star of David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_badge).

Oh yeah, it's an offensive song. Is it appropriate for a band to compare the Nazis' atrocities to the personal views of a California governor? Probably not. But that's what makes it compelling: as stupid and absurd as the lyrics are, you have to confront the stupidity. It's not a matter of whether you agree or disagree, it's too extreme to really agree with; you come to understand _why_ you disagree. That's the strength of satire that I'm beginning to think people are unable to detect. If the art doesn't make you reassess your position on something, it hasn't done its job.

Not that I think there's much depth to the song. It's simply very funny. More than any politics, the song is about _stupidity_, particularly the American ideal that anything can happen through the sheer power of belief. Notably, Jerry is a Democrat and Biafra is pretty left-leaning. It doesn't matter who advocates for what when they say stupid shit.

Biafra could've made his point without the Nazi comparisons. Maybe. But it wouldn't have been as colorful. And "morbid" is a color in life.
