Whether one could argue that Marlon Brando in "On The Waterfront" is overacting or acting against the script does not matter.

Elia Kazan's "On The Waterfront" is simple: the mob is cheating the longshoremen of Hoboken and justice needs to be served. Brando's Terry Malloy too is a simple role: he is a man who has an ostensible connection with the mob but has a humble heart closer to the workers' of the waterfront. One could argue the role is better served by softer acting, someone whose submissiveness shows his raging guilt, and his pride divided in two halves: the half that believes a man is a solitary sovereign of his own fate and the other half that believes in justice however lofty. That would be the minimum.

History, however, has it exactly as Martin Scorsese said: "When you watch his work in 'On the Waterfront' ... youâ€™re watching the purest poetry imaginable, in dynamic motion." Brando _is_ the movie, he overcomes the movie, though Karl Malden as Pete Barry is given beautiful monologues as the pastor of an exploited community.

His acting is so good it looks like he is overacting, because he makes everyone else around him look stiff as a board. His Malloy isn't larger than life or pops out of the screen, his performance isn't the province for any cliche, but everything from his body language to his facial expression to the way he approaches his lines is magnificent. His Malloy is a vortex of thoughts - Brando combines seemingly disparate men, that of a prideful ex-boxer who could have taken the title, of a gentle caretaker of pigeons, and of a survivor who has full knowledge that a man walks on the earth only to eat his bread. He transforms on screen, the most noticeable transition being from when he is chided into spying on the pastor's secret meeting, hanging his head down reading skin mags making a pitiful attempt to disguise his guilt, to him seating himself with a cocky air onto the church's pews, pretending this holier-than-thou priest couldn't tell him squat. His deflections from the priest's accusations - "How can we call ourselves Christians and protect these murders with our silence?" - are at once the stone face of a man with few cares and yet those same cares eating up the very bottom of his soul. Or, too, take the scene where he enters the bar, his hand bloody wielding a gun. What is he? A wounded animal, more animal than wounded, more wounded than animal? Is his suffering pathetic or dignified? I've literally never seen anything like it; it's either the editing, the film quality or him.

The overdramatic plot of "On The Waterfront" in spite of eight Academy Awards would have been relegated to the dustbins of history if Brando did not steal the spotlight. It really is a sight to be seen.

And so, to talk on one of the most famous scenes of movie history.

Or, should I say, one of the most famous _moments_ of movie history. If a scene is considered an encapsulation of an idea, then, to many people, including me, this scene will not impress. It lacks the fundamental context, that of Malloy's character and his relationship with his brother Charley up to that point. Yet once we understand everything preceding it, in every audience member's mind, the moment clicks - not in a fiery burst, as we imagine greatness does, but as if a single star quietly yet inalterably illuminated the night of our thoughts, giving us revelation.

What characterizes Malloy is, that as much as he mopes, he still needs to make human connections with others. The movie is rife with that tension. Surrounded by violence and tough living, prior to meeting Edie the only source of tenderness, though tiny at best, came from his brother Charley and the mafia organization he works for. He does not dislike the longshoremen, but, besides Joey, the dead man, he didn't seem to have a particularly intimate connection with any of them. No wonder he approaches life with such lethargy.

Adding onto this is a vision of a life in the complete opposite, that of a champion boxer. Sure, the title wasn't necessarily his, but he had the shot, and all he has is a dream of that shot if he didn't take the dive so eagerly prescribed by Johnny Friendly.

Malloy has spent the whole movie defending his brother Charley, his sole source of human comfort - and before we enter the car, Charley has spent the whole movie, albeit behind the scenes, defending his little brother as a potential mole. Malloy struggles to speak to his brother - after all, he is trying to put into words one of the greatest of human maladies, guilt. His brother, so mired in the mud of the mafia, can't think outside of the organization; he _needs_ his brother to be part of his team, as his identity is so wound up with it. The struggle within both of their souls is immense, and finally, almost unprompted, Charley pulls out a pistol against his brother, though it really isn't pointed at Malloy - it's really pointed at _his_ guilt.

Malloy sees through the act, shakes his head and lowers his brother's gun, upset that he has seen an act quite pathetic coming from his sole family. Still stunned, he rests his left hand on his cheek and glances out of the car window, saying "Wow."

The odd thing about these hardened Jerseyans is that in their daily lives they never let up their visage of toughness. Bringing up a gun doesn't make them bat an eye. Instead, under the formality of violence, they loosen up - they no longer struggle for words and begin to speak each other honestly, for the first time in the film.

Charley reminisces on the happier, perhaps more promising days of their lives: the time Malloy was a competitive boxer. His mind turns to Malloy's weight, his physical condition, his career, and then towards his manager and his hawkish careerism.

To which Malloy, or rather Brando, in that smooth pivot of his head and jaw, which bobs back and forth in the light as if shaking the shadow of the doubt, retorts, "It wasn't him, Charley, it was you.

"Remember that night in the Garden, you came down to my dressing room and said 'Kid, this ain't your night. We're going for the prize on Wilson.' You remember that?"

He says with full confidence; he _asserts_ now, holding onto the specter that has haunted him for so long. Brando's performance is inimitable, saying the lines with half a smile on his face, at once happy remembering the apex of his career in the Garden and knowing full well that his brother, though unconsciously, is trying to diminish his splendor with re-edited memories. He isn't lamenting when he mentions he could have torn Wilson apart and instead was sent to Nowheresville. And yet he says:

"You was my brother, Charley, you should have looked out for me a little bit."

Malloy reveals that he gave up the fight for his brother, and he was content giving it up for his brother. In Brando's words is a tender rebuke. He is invoking bonds of blood.

His brother tries pathetically to defend himself by saying Malloy received money for his pains ultimately, but Malloy fiercely, yet just as gently, retorts:

"You don't understand, I coulda had class! I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody."

You need to see the scene to understand everything Brando accomplishes. From the lines alone you would interpret Malloy as being frustrated. Yet the context is all-important here: Malloy is frustrated, yes, but not about the match that is long gone now, that he had given for his brother. No, what he is frustrated by is his brother's lack of understanding that he committed a big part of his life to him. And in that enunciation of "somebody", which is said with so much humanity that you can see the stretch of spit in Brando's mouth as he says it, Brando puts the full world in that eight-letter long word - and Malloy is fully saying, "That 'somebody' is something we both could have shared in." Brando's eyes appeal to the sky above, looking into the beautiful future of that big if. It demonstrates, so perfectly, how much Charley sacrificed for money and connections, and how much Malloy sacrificed for Charley.

This scene is the pivot point for the whole movie. Up until this point, the community is fractured; neighbors do not join together, no one agrees with each other, everyone is so tough they must be miserable. There is no milk of human kindness. In this exchange Malloy lays his heart bare, not to his lover, Edie, whom he exchanges romance as is the usual tender, but to his brother, explicating that there really is nothing the other can withhold, not even under the threat of the mob. This is the kind of connection Father Barry is fighting for. This little bit of honesty breaks through the macho armor worn by the community - people become petty, selfish, even irrationally emotional, but the honesty is necessary to have justice, as is shown in the film.
