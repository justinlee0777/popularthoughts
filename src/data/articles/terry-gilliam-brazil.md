Gilliam's "Brazil" is a farcical masterpiece on how technology makes people stupid. In a society ever obsessed to infinity with automating processes, and feeding enormous amounts of data into those processes all in the quixotic quest to make them work in the first place, Gilliam has the nastiest phlegm-throated laugh at those who conflate efficiency, safety, and immortality with humanity.

God bless him. God bless his expensive and demeaning vision. God bless his contempt for his publishers. God bless his begrudging respect for his first co-writer. God bless his inadequacy with money. And God bless his disregard for "facts". Facts enter our life with the ceremony of a contract, and fact checks are begrudged as if they were receipts. The unqualified acceptance of the fact is the death of thinking.

I'm sure its symbolism and dream-like plot have been examined already, far better than I could. I'm sure lists have been made of its best quotes, of which even the smallest, most inconsequential piece of dialogue ranks; among mine, "It's all right, I don't like you either," "Your very own number, on your very own door," "Tell them no, tell them yes." The only task remaining is to see the film. I'll talk about the ending of the film - with spoilers.

For the first-time viewer there may be much fretting over its length - 2 and a half hours, though the first is breathless, a savage flaying of Gilliam's society, of _this_ society. The world as seen is a "Blade Runner" with human blood and breath. It, coming after, outdoes Scott's. In "Blade Runner", people are only victims of Scott's beautifully-rendered, yet always melancholy world. In "Brazil", people fight back, with snark, with contempt, with laziness, and yet the system fights back with just as much sarcasm; for this reason, the world of "Brazil" is the superior world, feeling lived in, even though, yes, it's very, very funny, almost rendered to cartoon proportions if it weren't so uncomfortably true. Yet as the "plot" and its James Bond shenanigans begin, you hesitate, thinking this bit of indulgence could be the reason why it's not _that_ well-known. You even fear the film may overstay its welcome.

The critical point is when Sam meets Jill. "This is a love story now?" you sink in your chair, sighing. You think, He and the girl will have some trials, fight the system, leave - too romantic for his own good, but that scene where Kim Greist coos "Care for a little necrophilia?" is perfectly done, a perfect aesthetic ending for the movie.

But there's more movie afterwards. Sam gets captured, evidently to be tortured, only to be freed by more James Bond shenanigans. Christ, is he going to join the rebels? What is this?

Yet when Tuttle becomes consumed by paper, feeble in the face of removing one document from his shoe to horrifically swallowed by massive piles of trash, you begin to harbor the fear that this is a dream. After all, this is Freudian - the god-like helper of the hero is taken away by something as evil and quotidian as trash, which represents Sam's ordered yet unordered life.

And you find yourself whispering, "Run, Sam, run."

Well, what do you want? Do you want the naive, head-over-heels, perhaps somewhat childish Sam to win, or lose? Do you want him to be strapped to that chair? As a realist, my mind says he is still at the chair, dreaming. As a romantic, my mind wants him to be free. So too does my humane side.

As you watch more dream-like escape after dream-like escape, culminating in the resurrected Jill driving him away from the streets and the billboards into the countryside, you feel more relief, happy knowing where the film ends.

Only for Gilliam to pull the rug beneath you. All that is left is Sam, holes in his hands, humming songs setting scenes only in his head. His executioner sighs. "He is gone." His former friends, now spectators, leave. We are left with a wide shot of Sam alone in an immense auditorium, waiting for his death. Credits roll to the triumphant, mirthful, epic theme, Geoff Muldaur's variation of Ary Barroso's "Aquarela do Brazil", whom the film owes its name. This is the last rug pull.

I stopped breathing. I really did find it hard to breathe. As I walked home I struggled for gasps. I'll never forgive the film for this trick. And so, to me, it will always be a masterpiece.
