"Why do people have to live outside?" Raygun Busch growls and yelps on the second track of Chat Pile's "God's Country", a question Ian MacKaye - almost - 20 years ago posed in "Cashout", and answered: "The elected are such willing partners / Look who's buying all their tickets to the game / Development wants; development gets, it's official / Development wants the neighborhood gone so the city wants the same." For that reason, MacKaye in Fugazi's refrain sounds far more angry on a lesser shout budget.

All to say Chat Pile is nothing new and even immature by way of repeating other older artists. Most artists are aware enough to know grunting is grunting, and grunting for the sake of grunting is Marxism by assumption that only the proles, or the college students wearing the accoutrement of the proles, would appreciate it. Music has been more daring. Music has been more controversial. To Pile's "Slaughterhouse", is Big Black's "Kerosene". To "Wicked Puppet Dance", Jay Reatard's "Puppet Man". To "Tropical Beaches, Inc", Minutemen's "Corona". Perhaps I have nothing really to say on the music itself and aim at edgelords if only for the ease of it.
