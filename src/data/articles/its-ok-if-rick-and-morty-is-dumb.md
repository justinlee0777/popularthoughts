I finally got around to watching Rick and Morty season 4. 4 episodes in, I'm enjoying the heck out of it - more than I enjoyed season 3, certainly. It's probably the best work the writing team (and the animators) have done for the entire show.

I find Rick and Morty to be a curiously clever show, possibly more than it should be. The first episode of the season depicts Rick and Morty feeling resigned to their fate - to make one-off adventures each episode, which, as a joke, is funny, but doesn't make the show smart in any way. Being aware is one thing, then there's 4th dimensional being-aware-and-elevating-it-beyond-awareness-to-the-point-you're-not-aware-anymore.

Rick and Morty has always been aware, but has never elevated beyond awareness. The best comparison, that I think readers would know of, is Aqua Teen Hunger Force, a show where you are never sure if the writers are aware of what the joke is. You're aware the show is supposed to be stupid and you laugh at the stupid jokes, but certain episodes are so bizarre and contain so little logic, for example Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, that you stop being sure what, precisely, is the joke anymore. You question whether the episode has jokes or whether it's just one long trip, man.

I'm coming around to the opinion that what makes Rick and Morty special are the visual gags and the incredible work of the animation team. We know countless ink has been spilled discussing the philosophy and characters of Rick and Morty, but neither are substantial.

Story structure is the argumentative structure of a work of fiction - the fiction makes a logical proof of its conclusion through the story structure, basically. The Hero of a Thousand Faces documents the argumentative structure of many mythological stories - the hero, representing the element of renewal, brings about change to a static, destructive environment (caused by a tyrant or natural disaster). The idea that a man wields a special sword and slays dragons is fictitious and silly; that he is the symbol of independence and freedom, and the dragon is the symbol of tyranny, one-sided thinking, etc., is the logical message we get from the story through analogy.

(I'll leave aside why story structure **must** be the sole arguer for a future article. But it's easy to argue that content can't - because by fiction's nature, you can manipulate content to make any argument possible. So no cigar.)

Rick and Morty has a typical story structure every single episode, even in the "dark" Season 3. A character gets him or herself in a mess, and they get out of the mess; more often than not, the mess was of their own doing. Philosophically speaking, you can't do much with that. The characters either succeed or they don't; and because we're constantly reminded any of their adventures could result in horrible, horrible failure, argumentatively speaking no one can really succeed or fail in Rick and Morty. So "life sucks" is the message of Rick and Morty. A more complicated show would vary the circumstances - whether the character caused the issue they are fixing, how they attempt to solve the issue, the outcome - to make a better philosophical argument, but Rick and Morty doesn't do that. I've always cited Dr Stone as a popular animated show <a href="https://youtu.be/B5iyC94hh-4)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that has philosophical complexity</a>.

The characters don't add complexity either, because they have fairly 1-dimensional valences - they either hate or encourage a situation they are in. If a character participates in a scenario, it typically has less to do with whatever skills or interest they have concerning the scenario, but whether they just happen to have nothing better to do at the moment.

Well, anyway, that's not really the point of Rick and Morty; it's necessary to address these storytelling elements, but it doesn't take away that the show is really funny and really creative. I laughed hysterically at Rick and Heistotron's back-and-forth at the end of episode 3 - it's an amazing punchline that required an almost flawless execution of the episode, from start to finish, to land (same goes for Morty's arc too). Rick and Morty is an amazing vehicle to tell sci-fi/fantasy/nerd jokes, and the more jokes in an episode pertinent to its setting/premise, the better the episode is. That's why I was so indifferent to Season 3 - as creative as it was, the characters weren't enough to pull the show through. The premise of an episode, where it is set and what the broad conflict is (heists are stupid, Rick continuously reincarnates in a fascist universe), is what makes the show so juicy and tender, because the writers pull off miraculous punchlines and the animators execute beautiful sight-gags the more laser-focused everything is. Season 4 is running on all cylinders, baby. For the time being, I'm a complete Rick and Morty fan.
