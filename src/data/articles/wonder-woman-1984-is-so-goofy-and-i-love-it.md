"Wonder Woman 1984" is so corny and yet I still love it.

One early scene keyed me in that the production was a bit tongue-in-cheek. A robber holds a little girl hostage in the first action scene of the film, and just as the robber drops the little girl from the height of a mall his robber friend says "Nooooo!" That guy ... was chewing the scenery clean.

I think I like Wonder Woman more than other superheroes, and I think it's precisely because she's so *goofy*. I mean, Wonder Woman has really random equipment (bracers that deflect things, rope that tells the truth, invisible jet) and her staple of villains consist of a cheetah, a witch who turns people into pigs, a woman with a hypnotic whip and a psychologist. I like how Wonder Woman just kinda cops to it, y'know. Superman is somewhere fighting a world-threatening alien with super intelligence, and Wonder Woman is dealing with pig lady; and you know what, pig lady is a threat. Just because Superman has too much time to deal with pig lady doesn't mean pig lady doesn't need dealing with.

When it comes down to it, I really just want a Wonder Woman movie to be about *her*, about Diana Prince having to deal with weird things and her personal reaction to them. I don't want another Marvel movie, about saving the world from this existentialist threat or whatever.

The movie met my expectations by having a lot of personal moments with Wonder Woman. When Gal Gadot appeared as Wonder Woman in "Batman v. Superman", I thought she was cast out of desperation ("who looks like Wonder Woman" etc). But over the course of this series she has been a great Wonder Woman. Gadot depicts Wonder Woman as a quiet, thoughtful person whose primary faults are her stubbornness and her reservations as a superhero. I'm really happy that Gadot's Wonder Woman is not someone dealing with some existentialist crisis; she is dealing with a personal crisis, that of loneliness as a ... mythical Amazonian princess.

Her and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor have excellent chemistry with each other. One could see Steve as a hindrance to the plot, but I like him quite a bit as Wonder Woman's sidekick; I'll genuinely miss him in future films, if existing.

Kristen Wiig did an adequate job as Barbara Minvera; I can't say she added much to the character. Cheetah, as a villain, was very meh, though she served the plot well as a kinda-sorta symbol of mankind's meanness.

Maxwell Lord's depiction was shockingly good. The actor, Pedro Pascal, did a good job, but the character as written in the script took over the whole film. There was pretty much no room for any other villain in the plot. On paper the idea that the antagonist of the film is a guy who grants wishes is a silly, silly idea, but the movie sells the notion that this character is really feeding on people's sadness, anger and frustration, which is well within Wonder Woman's wheelhouse. Executed in the film, he's genuinely menacing.

It basically comes down to: Wonder Woman has to deal with mankind destroying itself over magic wishes. I would have never thought I wanted to see this film. Patty Jenkins sells it completely.

The film is very flawed though. In one instance, Wonder Woman is in Egypt amid political upheaval; the next day, she's in Washington DC. In another, Maxwell Lord is in some tundra; in the next, he's back in Washington D.C, his son conveniently hiding in the bushes he calls towards. Wonder Woman makes a passing line about making things invisible. (However, her making a coffee cup invisible and then losing the coffee cup is really, really funny to me.)

The film is truly bloated at 2 and a half hours long. I had a bit of mental math - there are 4 action scenes (beginning robbery, car chase, white house, finale). Cut out the car chase and the white house fight; have Wonder Woman find out Max is doing evil things and establish Barbara Minerva's transition into Cheetah in other ways. Cut out *most* of the scenes with Barbara; it's sufficient to have scenes where Gadot calls Barbara without showing Kristen Wiig on-screen. (Barbara Minerva hardly has a character arc anyway; we feel very little for her at the end of the film, except as a physical symbol of the wishes-gone-bad premise.) In fact, you can try to trim the film's location down to just Washington D.C., which is a true creative exercise but I think quite possible. The image of Maxwell Lord alone entering the White House is just menacing. However, keep every scene with Steve Trevor and Wonder Woman. Those are the point of the film. They also happen to be the best parts of the film.
