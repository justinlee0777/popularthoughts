You know what, Smash Mouth's "All Star" is a great song. It may, to everyone's chagrin, end up in the American musical canon. Perhaps I should petition for its 7-inch single to be preserved by the Library of Congress.

I'm not sure if I'm joking, to tell you the truth, as much as I'm not sure if the song itself is a joke.

There are already two articles by <a href="https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/music/2019/5/3/18525721/smash-mouth-all-star-20th-anniversary-memes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ringer</a> and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/smash-mouth-all-star-oral-history-829197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rolling Stone</a> that cover the song's history more thoroughly than I could. As far as analysis goes, here's one I stole from Genius about the line "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RENaL49iw&t=158s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Didn't make sense not to live for fun</a>", which I agree with.

For the longest time I too thought it was a joke, until I re-evaluated it recently. Looking at the lyric sheet, there's nothing about it that's funny. This isn't on the level of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIt2CdbBo_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell"</a>. I think the off-putting quality of the song comes from its execution, particularly the use of idioms ("I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed"), the informal language ("She was looking kinda dumb / With her finger and her thumb / in the shape, of an L, on her forehead"), Harwell's singing style, ("differ" = "diffa", "picture" = "pick-cha", "bored" = "buh-yored"), the use of samples, the "wicky-wick" sound, and the dumb optimism of the chorus. The first three fit in with punk conventions - not within the 90s, I'm talking Buzzcocks and Dead Kennedys here - so they're really non-problems. The other two are the faults of Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys. As for the last, well, I look at it as a case of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8qcccZy03s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"I reject your reality and substitute my own."</a> It's basically the message of <a href="/everything-everywhere-all-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Everything Everywhere All At Once"</a> except it works here. Unlike an equivalent pop song by, say, Logic, I relate with Greg Camp. First, he was responding to letters from children who felt like outcasts, so there's an actual bit of realism. Second, it's not like the band was composed of sell-outs from the beginning - from Camp's explication of starting out in a cover band and being called a loser for it, to documenting the miseries of tour in "Then The Morning Comes", there is a dealing with reality here, but a decision to not look at "facts" for what they are. And really, isn't the idea of a "rockstar" in everyone's head? Is it really so great to be Elvis, Jim Morrison, or Kurt Cobain? You might as well take the image of a rockstar and make it work for you.

Oh, and it's also perceived as a joke because it's a great karaoke song, but, because of the aforementioned qualities, it's a karaoke song because it's a great song.

These lyrics frequently associate the song with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qkqdm7/is-smash-mouth-all-star-about-climate-change-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">climate change</a>:

It's a cool place;<br/>
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older,<br/>
But the meteor men beg to differ<br/>
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture.<br/>
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin,<br/>
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim.<br/>
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?<br/>
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.<br/>

but as Camp repeats, over and over again, to the chagrin of his interviewer, it's meant to be metaphorical. The way I look at it is, everyone at any time thinks the world is ending and things are getting worse, but the narrator, rather than accepting that narrative, rolls his eyes and tries to make something good out of their situation. This fits in with the earlier couplet, "So much to do, so much to see / So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?" and later,

I said "Yup, what a concept<br/>
I could use a little fuel myself, and we could all use a little change,"<br/>

a pun, and a groaner going by Harwell's wink.

The reason why I wanted to write about "All Star" in the first place is because I thought deeply on the origin of the song: 1999, the year HBO chose for its to-be infamous <a href="/woodstock-99-pinkerton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woodstock '99</a> documentary. Smash Mouth didn't participate, but the musical similarities are there: the slacker imagery, the punk-pop influence, the "wicky-wick" sound.

I still think on Weezer's "Pinkerton" a lot, and what makes "All Star" refreshing is that it is nearly the complete negative to "Pinkerton", indeed a negative of the false rebellion of the 90s. It is even a negative of Nirvana. Cobain and Cuomo sing on how it sucks to live; Harwell sings about how life is life, man. The nice thing is, it's not like Cuomo and Harwell don't empathize with one another. You can listen to "Tired of Sex", "All Star", and "Rape Me" in sequence. You can even put them in a playlist together. No matter what existential crisis you are going through, or what misery you are empathizing with, there absolutely can be a moving-on, an acceptance of suffering and a real attempt to improve. There is a having-your-cake-and-eating-it-too.

And so I've come to admire the rejection of imposed narratives in "All Star" - from outsiders and from the self, as the self can construct false stories as well, perhaps even better and worse than outsiders can. In fact, that irreverence towards conformity comes from the first second of the song, which DJs have complained makes it impossible for the song to be talked over. For that reason, I find the song pretty darn American too: as believers that people have a choice in their destiny, Smash Mouth may have inadverterntly made an All-American Great.
