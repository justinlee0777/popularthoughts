Coming right off the heels of Dressrosa, the Straw Hats (Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Robin and Franky) travel to Zou. I like the idea that they have at least a little adventure in every island they visit. Maybe a monkey mink finds the samurai's emblem on their ship, possibly torn off Kinemon or Kanjuro's kimono, and tries to warn the other minks. The minks wouldn't know how the Straw Hats look like, as news doesn't reach their island, obviously (and Luffy isn't wearing his famous straw hat at the moment). The Straw Hats try to stop him, getting into trouble with a variety of mink scouts, before hearing the growling of Nekomamushi and Inuarashi. They manipulate their rivalry with one another, cutting a path of destruction through this cat-and-dog chase, before Kinemon arrives and stops this whole charade. Perhaps they meet up with Nami and company in this way, setting up the minks' supposed hatred for samurai. Also, I have an odd sense of humor concerning history, so I love the idea that the Straw Hats run around Zou with someone saying "This is the historic place where so-and-so did such-and-such," only for Nekomamushi and Inuarashi to destroy it.

Anyway, the whole set-up with Jack and Raizo is fine, and all of Whole Cake Island is good to me. For those who aren't familiar - though this whole write-up would be extremely confusing to those who aren't caught up - the gang have to save Sanji, who was abducted by his murder family, who want to join Big Mom, an emperor of the sea, who wants a big wedding party between Sanji and her daughter, so she can eat a delicious wedding cake, though she doesn't know a number of people are trying to assassinate her at that event. It's a wonderful story with twists and turns. Jinbei actually has an important role in it, and he feels like a true Straw Hat. It ends with them saving Sanji and heading off to Wano, to beat the crap out of Kaidou.

### Rewriting Wano

I will retain Oda's three-act struture.

These are the substantial changes to the Wano story:

1. **Law-less** - Law has already been given a substantial character treatment in Dressrosa. Law is not a member of the Straw Hats. Law as a character needs to be treated as a threat on his own. You can't have him in a story with Luffy and Kidd and not have him be eclipsed, lest you derail the story as to be unfocused. I will distract Law by having his crew be intercepted by the Blackbeard Pirates - this makes sense to me, as Blackbeard would drool over his Operation Human abilities and want to eliminate a genuine rival to the One Piece. (**Note**: Hand on my heart I wrote this before Chapter 1063.)

2. **This town's not big enough for Big Mom** - Big Mom is also trivialized in Wano. I understand that she is so much of a threat that one wonders why she would allow the balance of power to shift, but her empire had recently been destabilized by the Straw Hats _and_ the Sun Pirates. It is true Big Mom is vengeful to fanaticism, and perhaps would want to capture "Black Leg" Sanji for her own cook, but I think this is something we can narratively hand-wave. As what to do with her after Wano, that is a difficult question to solve, but for the sake of _this_ story, let us keep her out so as not to crowd out Kaidou's unusualness.

3. **Ta-ma get the hell out of here** - To tell you the truth, I don't know what Oda was thinking with this character. Usually I understand what Oda is thinking when I try to remove a character from the story; Tama, without exaggeration, is _extremely easy_ to remove without losing much. She does act as a sympathetic, someone the audience can easily empathize with. But she is replaceable with Otoko. She _really_ ruins the story: she does not have an interesting character, she has no personal involvement in the story, and her ability is so ambiguous it borders on stupid. I think Oda has her to fulfill his own personal military fascination with numbers and turning battles around, but the way she does is so, so boring. _I could give a shit about powerscaling._ I would prefer Luffy backhand all of Kaidou's henchmen if I thought it was interesting (it isn't, but that's besides the point).

4. **The supreme Marines** - I don't care much for the ultimate conflict of Beast Pirates versus everyone else. A conflict is interesting because all sides of the conflict are interesting; the Beast Pirates are not interesting. And we know "everyone else" has to win. The Marines have been almost utterly absent in this entire story, with Smoker and Fujitora reduced to sobbing sideliners in Punk Hazard and Dressrosa respectively, so I would prefer to add them to remind everyone they're in the story. With them, every side becomes a bit interesting: the Marines have an opportunity to get rid of multiple enemies; the Beast Pirates are in a dangerous crisis, flanked on both sides by powerful enemies; the Straw Hats want Kaidou's head, for personal reasons.

5. **The story of Momotaro** - Now that we have brought the Marines in, we can transfer over Akainu, Kizaru and Aokiji, named after heroes in the story of Momotaro. I've never thought Akainu being fleet admiral prevented him from participating on the field; a clear historical precedent is Richard I, the Lionheart. (This would mean Akainu is not a particularly _good_ fleet admiral.) Having Sentomaru - literally named "Battle Peach Boy" - in the story may be taking it too far; if we were to keep him, he should be the empathetic voice of the Marines. Yes, Sentomaru is quite loyal to the Marines, but he still has a conscience. He would lead Pacifistas initially and eventually work with Momonosuke to stop the island from descending. Maybe he will choose to live in Wano as a "diplomat" for the World Government, when in reality he secretly wants to be a famous yokozuna.

Right off the bat, the Whole Cake Island crew will not enter the country until Act II.

We begin the story with Zoro's execution. He turns the situation around and instead executes the corrupt magistrate trying to execute him. Zoro then leaves the Flower Capital on his own adventure. He is not speaking to the other Straw Hats in fear of compromising their identities.

Not too far from the capital is the shanty town, where he meets Kiku, Otsuru and Otoko. They talk about the country's problems, but all Zoro wants is booze.

Zoro will be heavily invested in looking for booze his entire journey. I understand this may be an exaggeration of one of his character traits, but I'd rather give him a uniting goal rather than have him sit around waiting for something to do.

They mention that, in-between Kaidou's goons and the bandits nearby, they have no food or drink. At that moment, Ashura's gang comes in; Ashura himself is particularly incensed that they have nothing left to steal, saying their lives aren't worth anything to him if they have nothing worth taking. Of course this bothers Zoro and he challenges him to a duel. This is his first duel with a (living) samurai.

As it turns out, this will not be an easy challenge for him. Ashura is one of the stronger Red Scabbards, and his fighting Kaidou's men has only sharpened his skills. As an artist, he practices a style befitting of his size. With a massive _odachi_, a two-handed sword more fit for cutting horses than people, he defeats his opponents with overwhelming strength, often piercing his opponent's guard; yet his size also hides his sheer arm speed, and he often boasts that, for a true samurai, every blow should be the finishing blow.

Ashura plants himself over a flower and boasts, "It's not about this flower... What it is, is that 'you will never be able to move my shadow away from this flower.' D'you understand? This flower will never see sunlight unless I choose to move away from it." This is his style, focused heavily on lightning-fast, crushing blows. Zoro is impressed: after hours of fighting Ashura, he says that Ashura is like a sacred mountain, the home of ancient trees and lingering mists; no matter how long one gazes at it, one cannot penetrate it through pure sight alone. A small mind cannot move a mountain.

With this, Zoro fights Ashura on his own merits - using strength and speed, he gets closer and closer to his throat in hair-raising, death-defying duels until he finally gives him a grievous cut.

Inauspiciously, at this time Kaidou's men decides to set their hideout ablaze. Having communicated to Ashura with his blade, however, Zoro says he will protect their hideout singlehandedly. They, of course, do not believe him. But he does it.

Jack himself is ordered by Queen to use his poisonous rounds against Zoro to end the conflict quickly and capture the Pirate Hunter, so he may play with him. Queen threatens Jack, lest he becomes a twice-loser after the kerfuffle at Zou.

Zoro gets locked up with Hyogoro, replacing Luffy in the current story. Kid and Kawamatsu are locked in somewhere as well. Queen thinks he can break Zoro's spirit, not understanding the swordsman is only motivated by booze. Kid and Zoro constantly bicker all day, stating how easy it would be to kill the other (unlike the brother-brother relationship he has with Luffy). Zoro's swords, locked up by Queen, are stolen by Onimaru.

To further break Zoro's spirit and for his own entertainment Queen decides to pit Zoro against the Gifters (who have been salivating for revenge), giving him only a rusty sword. As a further taunt, he handcuffs his dominant hand to Hyogoro's. This does not deter him, as he has experience fighting with someone literally bound to his hand (Usopp, cough cough). Hyogoro notices his masterful application of Haki on the sword, protecting it from any chips whatsoever, and is astounded how similar Zoro is to Ryuma, whose Shusui became a black blade by the sheer quantity of Haki poured onto it. Hyogoro swears he will teach this young man everything he knows.

Frustrated that Zoro keeps winning, Queen sets the maddened Killer on him. Zoro wins, but he is grievously wounded.

Queen, in a mocking rage, pummels Zoro after his victory, unable to think of a good way to break his spirit. Unbeknownst to him, Killer sneaks out and frees Kid from his shackles. Kid, predictably, goes ape.

Only thing I want to mention about Kid is that, Akira powers aside, he is a Magnet Man. I feel like Paramecia fruits have lost some of their quirkiness. Kid, as a Magnet Person, should be able to accelerate towards metal objects and punch people very hard. He could attract metal objects to him and, at the last second, jump away, thus causing a shotgun-like effect. He could smash people's heads by clapping. I imagine Kid can control the polarity across his entire body, so he can build things. He should be able to create substantial electromagnetic force, given he has an electric current.

Kid busts the entire prison open, setting everyone free. Since Queen is made out of cybernetic parts, Kid plays with him like a puppet. It's simply a bad match-up. Queen tries to escape, but Zoro chases him as he wants his booze. Queen easily destroys Zoro's rusty sword and kicks him out, leaving him in the wintry portion of Wano. Zoro in his twisted up logic believes he must have gone in a giant circle, ergo he is near the Flower Capital and close to Robin, but in reality he is on the complete opposite side of the island.

He meets Onimaru fairly quickly, who accuses him of stealing Shusui. They fight; Zoro catches his blade with his hands, a feat of such strength and skill that he recognizes some of his former master within Zoro. He swears fealty to Zoro, but he begs him to no longer use Shusui, as respect for the deceased Ryuma. They try to look for new swords, but Zoro comically rejects each and everyone, as they don't "feel" right.

Onimaru guides him back to the Flower Capital, which is in an uproar. Queen and Jack have left to Onigashima, leaving only the country's samurai to defend from various threats. They are especially sensitive as foreigners have entered the country.

Speaking of which, Kid and Killer see Queen's ship leaving for Onigashima in the distance. Killer: "There's not a scrap of metal in all of these villages; these houses were built out of timber and callused hands alone." Kid, though a violent stoic, seems to have a twinge of sympathy for these villagers. Then he points: "What about that?" He is looking at an immense factory in the distance.

Kid pulls the factory from the ground and smashes Queen with it. "Repel! Attract! Repel!" Queen tries to break it with his brachiosaurus head, but opts instead to pull out and make his escape fully.

Zoro obviously does not care and crashes into the shogun's palace which, predictably, has no booze, as all of it has been given to Onigashima. Zoro briefly recognizes Robin, who slaps him (to keep up the illusion but also because he's an idiot) and tells him to meet the crew at a discrete place.

Denjiro, awakened, quickly identifies Zoro as the runaway and challenges him to a duel.

Denjiro is the strongest samurai in Wano; he frequently fights Ashura and wins, protecting the Flower Capital as a result. He would have more influence if he didn't sleep so often.

His style of fighting is very different from Ashura's. By varying the rhythms of his attacks and "playing" with the blade, he creates illusions of his sword his opponents chase after while the real attack is somewhere out of their field of vision. Furthermore, he is skilled enough to wield the sword in a hypnotic pattern, setting his opponents to sleep for a deadly second. This sense of timing and his opponent's senses and this incredible hand speed are the result of his experience as a thief.

At the brink of death, Onimaru allows Zoro to use Shusui. Denjiro sees images of Asura for a moment and believes Zoro too is capable of creating illusions. Yet when Zoro finishes him, he retorts, "Why bother with fake swords when I can cut you with nine?"

All this time everyone, particularly Onimaru, has been lecturing Zoro on being a samurai, and he groans how he never wants to be a samurai after this experience.

End of Act I.

Act II begins with Robin explaining to Franky, Usopp and Zoro about the history of Wano: she recounts the fame of Lord Oden (without having known him personally), Orochi's rise in power and deal with Kaido, and the Scabbards' time travel plot to defeat Orochi, all of which bores them. Robin is trying to infiltrate Orochi's palace as a geisha, and Usopp and Franky are acting as older-younger-brother carpenters, to comedic effect. Robin is getting an understanding of Orochi's plans, and relates how once a group of ronin tried to kill Kaidou in Onigashima and Orochi burned their boats, anticipating their plot.

To influence Orochi, Robin suggests Zoro apply to replace Denjiro as the shogun's right-hand man. Zoro is horrified but trusts Robin enough to agree.

We now introduce Orochi, who is playing with girls and partying. It is revealed his ninjas are trying to keep him distracted from the security failures of the past week. When he finally has a chance to speak with Denjiro, he is furious, then brings up the fact that he hired a foreigner to do Denjiro's job for him; when he protests, Orochi berates him for being a loser, despite 20 years of dedicated service.

Orochi is dead-set on partying the week right up to the Fire Festival, but knows that the populace is particularly vulnerable now and is looking to him for guidance. To this end, he decides it's time to have a public execution - just take a random man off the street, pin the country's problems on him, and kill 'em. The ninjas arrange for a perfect execution. When Zoro finally arrives, he is told his only task is to look pretty - "I have at my beck and call the very demons of Hell! What worries should I have?" Robin, in disguise, speaks to Zoro at length, which makes the other geishas jealous due to her sudden access to the shogun.

Luffy and gang finally arrive into Wano after an adventure through the waterfall. Kinemon, Hyogoro and Onimaru meet up with them, per Zoro's request.

Predictably, Luffy wants to go to Kaidou immediately. He is persuaded not to, as he would ruin any chance for the samurai to successfully sneak into Onigashima after twenty years of planning. Instead, he joins Hyogoro in the mountains to study Haki, a la "Rocky 4". Everyone else makes the journey to the Flower Capital in an attempt to catch up with Robin.

Robin competes with Komurasaki for attention. Komurasaki can't compete with Robin's knowledge of history and worldly wisdom; Robin is a literal Scheherazade.

Kaidou enters the shogun's palace to drink with Zoro, hearing Orochi's new right-hand man is a heavy drinker as well. He recognizes Zoro, but he doesn't care, seeing the relatively-young pirate as an ant. Very drunk, Kaidou relates the story of Oden's Golden Hour. At the end of the story, Zoro states that Oden was a great man. Orochi, offended, blasphemes Oden's name, to which Zoro tells him to shut up; someone wonders how Orochi continues to hire insubordinate fighters.

Kaidou gravely arises; Orochi taunts Zoro for incurring Kaidou's wrath, when Kaidou brings his big meaty hand against Orochi and slaps him into the wall. Kaidou grits his teeth, tears dripping down, stating "Oden WAS a great man!

"I only have respect for the strong! The strong are free to do whatever they wish! That was why I had him killed! That was my wish and my pleasure, as the greater warrior!

"I ask you once more, Pirate Hunter: join my crew, composed only of the strongest of the strong!"

Zoro and Kaidou look square in the eye; then, in a split second, these two monsters pull out their weapons and clash, sending shockwaves through the palace.

They then stop, demanding more booze, immediately.

Robin, who was sure her plan was foiled, wonders what happened. An older oiran: "You cannot intrude! They exchanged their thoughts through their strength! There is only one rule for samurai: they speak with their swords!"

When the oiran is brought up other supposed examples of samurai rules, she merely says "Oh! I forgot about those!"

Kaidou either drinks Zoro under the table or the dispute never gets resolved. Kaidou then is told of Luffy's whereabouts. Kaidou shoots at Zoro, asking him if he will stop him from killing his captain. Zoro shoots back: "Luffy won't die." "You think I'm weak enough to show him mercy?" "You misunderstand: Luffy will defeat you!" Kaidou laughs; beneath his kimono, Zoro visibly shakes.

Orochi is furious at being hit, and orders Otoko to be executed for laughing at him. This causes Komurasaki to defend her, thus leading Denjiro to "kill" Komurasaki. Someone wonders how there can be so much bloodshed during festivities. Orochi criticizes Denjiro, but he asserts that a true vassal defends his lord's honor.

Kaidou enters the snow-capped mountains in his dragon's form, mixing with the mist. He drunkenly calls for Straw Hat, and, upon finding him, melts the entire mountain with his dragon breath. No kidding. Whitebeard blasted apart skyscrapers and shook an entire island, Kaidou needs to do something of equal merit. Luffy is extremely angry and tells Kaidou to play fair, but he's too drunk and the wind caused by the extreme change of temperature messes with his hearing. Drunkenly he curses Zoro for not joining him, and even gets upset for smacking Orochi, whom he doesn't like but is kinda useful as a puppet dictator. Then he complains that after so long he still hasn't found the One Piece, the samurai aren't that strong, no one is strong, his son hates him, et cetera, et cetera, and in his grief he knocks down various factories in the sky, causing pollution wherever they drop onto.

Luffy is livid, and tries to fight Kaidou, getting a grasp of Hyogoro's Haki lessons; he is beaten, of course. Kaidou is warned of an emergency/find of the century and flies back to Onigashima.

Orochi's ninjas coincidentally capture Yasuie; only after the fact do they realize he was a famous daimyo back in the day. Zoro tries to contact Robin, saying this wasn't part of the deal, but Robin cannot hear him; Orochi gone, giddy at the prospect of defeating so old an enemy, she has the palace all to herself, free to capture any intel she wants on the Flower Capital. She gets the blueprints of Onigashima, the size of Kaidou's forces, and discovers the poneglyph at the bottom of Wano; yet upon discovering this, the country's ninja catch her in the act.

They state only they know who Robin really is; only the government is privy to details about foreigners. Robin counters that this is all a ploy to keep the masses ignorant. Exactly! They say. Only the few are privileged with power. Now that she has overstepped boundaries, it is time to kill her. Robin escapes the shogun's palace, defeating many of the Oniwabanshu.

Outside, Yasuie makes his big speech against Orochi; everyone's eyes are on him. (Of particular note is Yasuie's claim that no samurai of any dignity would bow to Orochi, as he has stolen everything for his position.) Orochi proceeds to shoot Yasuie himself. People laugh at Yasuie's death. Zoro is incensed, but learns that their laughter is a result of experimental tests with the SMILE fruit. (Either residents were experimented with or Orochi fed them defective SMILE when they complained about hunger, in a Marie Antonette "Let them eat cake" kind of way.) This leads to Zoro decapitating Orochi himself (which he survives, thanks to his Devil Fruit). "I quit! The harm done to my honor is intolerable to any harm ever done to my person!"

Seemingly pleased with Yasuie's claim that he made up the revolutionary sign, Orochi hires an incompetent, sleeping wino to be his bodyguard (as he combines the best traits of Denjiro and Zoro and has none of their worst traits, namely insubordination).

As great as Robin is at being a spy, one of the ninjas manages to catch one of the revolutionary signs on her person, making them suspicious that the revolution is indeed not a hoax.

The Straw Hats and their allies gather together. Robin reveals her information; Usopp and Franky reveal they have been making ships; Kawamatsu and Onimaru reveal they have collected weapons; Hyogoro and Kinemon reveal they have amassed an army. They are ready to raid Onigashima at the eve of the Fire Festival, which would be most vulnerable at this time given their knowledge of the island and the size of the army residing there. Robin suggests there is most likely a traitor within their ranks due to several coincidences. She also discloses the army's hierarchy, noting that there is a mysterious figure ranking quite highly (this is implied to be Yamato, who I think is OK).

The eve of the Fire Festival. It is raining hard. No one is at the port, except for the Red Scabbards, and Zoro, who got lost. Kinemon is begged to halt the attack, though they have waited for years.

In the distance they see fires. Orochi and his army of samurai have arrived, to finally kill off the samurai. He boasts that no one will come to the port, as the bridges have been destroyed by his true second-in-command - none other than Kanjuro, the traitor. Kanjuro asserts that his true loyalty was for the Kurozumi clan. After so many years of deception, it is now time for the Scabbards to die.

Zoro rushes in to kill Kanjuro, but notes he is much, much stronger after he has revealed his identity; in fact, he may even be the strongest samurai encountered so far, as a result of his intense devotion to Orochi. Kanjuro has a unique style of fighting. He is a Brush Man. He does not use a sword but a brush, and his hair can become a brush when he so chooses. Thus, he will fight with either his blade or his hair, distracting his opponents while he is drawing something out of their field of vision. He can also paint himself a black blade which...allows for a three-sword style. Furthermore, his brush strokes alone are capable of all kinds of unique effects, due to the vivacity behind them alone. Or he can draw such a convincing picture of Oden that his version of Oden is actually equal to the fighting strength of the original.

We would think Zoro would fight Kanjuro, but the reality is that Kinemon tells Zoro to stop. Kinemon asks Kanjuro if everything he has said is true - that his true lord is Orochi, that he does not think that the Kozuki bloodline is the true royal bloodline, and that he never once felt companionship with his fellow samurai. Kanjuro taunts him, asserting yes. Kinemon then delivers a grievous blow on Kanjuro in an instant.

"You are not the Kanjuro I know. The true Kanjuro would never say such things about Lord Oden! All of you samurai, you are against but a 'picture' of Lord Oden! You may have forgotten what he was like, or you may have never met him! If I told you, you would not be 'over there'... you would be 'over here', crying 'Sunacchi!' with all the samurai of the past who stood up for Wano!" And thus Kinemon tells _his_ version of Lord Oden: how, in spite of being a bore, a crook, a womanizer and a layabout, he was a great friend and nearly a great father to not just the Scabbards but to all of Wano.

So there you go, we have a little bit of backstory in multiple places. We have Robin's "History for Dummies" version in the beginning of Act II, and we have Kinemon's actual memoir. Since no one was really with Oden when he was hanging out with Roger and Whitebeard, we cut that out. Basically Kinemon recounts his childhood, his retainership, and Oden's final words as well as protecting Oden's family after the palace was set on fire.

"Well-spoken, Kinemon." We hear Robin's voice. "There is nothing more evil than history falsified." She is seen riding on the Sunny. "This is who Lord Oden was! Your lord has lied to you and blinded your hearts, so you may be subservient to him. He does not want you to be free. But history removes the shackles of men! Now decide: will you fight on the side of the true samurai?"

Denjiro finally reveals his identity, confirming it is all true.

Orochi is furious, wondering why the boats are still intact. Kanjuro asserts he burned them. Franky and Usopp state those were decoy boats - any true carpenter would have known. Kinemon is commended for the cleverness of the revolutionary sign, pointing to the wharf - Kinemon did not realize it could be interpreted that way. (Robin smiles - the reality is that she dropped a _false_ sign for the ninjas to see, in order to confuse them about the true sign.)

Orochi orders the samurai to kill them immediately, but they hesitate. When Kanjuro tries to stand up, two of the Scabbards immediately strike at him again. "It's over! No one is left to help you! You once demanded loyalty from the samurai as their lord - but everyone does not see any lord here!" With that, they cut off Orochi's eight remaining heads.

Back at Onigashima, Kaidou is laughing menacingly over the recent news. He has finally got his hands on an Eternal Log Pose pointing to the One Piece.

End of Act II.

We get some context as to how the Beast Pirates operate. Almost everyone is located in the pleasure gardens outside of the palace - the reality is, when Kaidou is drunk enough he beats any and everyone. Only the truly monstrous people are within a mile from Kaidou: the Calamities, the Tobi Roppo, the Headliners, the Numbers and a great many Awakened Zoan users, along with some pets. Apoo is the DJ.

Just as the party is getting started, a messenger of Kaidou's stammers out an announcement: The location of the One Piece has been found. They are now officially on the crew of the next Pirate King.

Yet just as everyone celebrates, the envoy then says: Kaidou has entered a melancholic stupor (from drinking) and has decided to kill himself.

"What? Just like that?! Just as we had the One Piece in our hands?! What are we supposed to do now?"

Everyone is considering stealing the Log Pose themselves, but the Tobi Roppo and the Calamities stand formidably in their way. They drink wine and eat, commenting that this is no news: if Kaidou lives then they set sail for the One Piece tomorrow, and if he dies then they fight for the new leader tomorrow. This is what the fate of the strong is.

Ships are narrated as coming towards the island, heavy with the burden of fate. However, they are revealed these are not the ships of our heroes - these are the ships of the Navy. Upon finding that Kaidou has a definite course for the One Piece, an emergency Buster Call has been summoned to wipe out Onigashima and potentially Wano if the information has leaked. The balance of the world is at stake.

Cannon fire rocks the island. The drunk Beast Pirates fumble in their defense. In all this, Admiral Kizaru breezes past everyone and zips into Kaidou's bedchamber, just as he did in Sabody Archipelago - only this time, he gets blown back by the Tobiroppo, who assert that not even a Marine Admiral could laugh at them and their masterful application of Haki. Kizaru smiles, as he has not received such a challenge in a while.

The Pacifistas are being overwhelmed by the Gifters/Headliners, and the naval defenses are better assembled than the Marines would imagine - a great number of Gifters are dismantling the ships. Furthermore, the cannons don't have enough range to penetrate the palace itself. With this the Marines come up with an idea - while the other ships act as distraction, one intrepid ship will sail into the country's rivers and pierce the enemy's defenses alone; they will unlock the enemy's gates so the battleships can enter the bay and be within comfortable striking distance of the palace and therefore Kaidou. A particular giant Vice Admiral - get the cat guy from Marineford in there, we'll give him a Zoan thing going on - is selected, and he bravely gets through...

...only to see the more-giant-than-giant Numbers blocking their way. Nevertheless, he opens the gate and the navy enters the bay.

At this point, our heroes have reached the island. They see a skeleton crew patrolling the island. The samurai insist on taking them down - they have no chance against Kaidou, but they can assist the Straw Hats in taking out everyone else.

As is typical of our heroes, compared to the marines' methodical, logical approach, they just blast into the thick of things recklessly. Using the Sunny's cannon, Usopp destroys a particularly vulnerable cliff in the backside of the island, allowing the ships to disembark safely there without the enemy knowing.

Just as Luffy disembarks first, promising to beat Kaidou up, it is revealed Akainu has personally attended to ensure this mission succeeds, and he finally steps into the bay.

As a note, Luffy and Akainu will never meet during this arc. Everyone but Luffy will meet Akainu. This to me is really funny.

Given the twin threats, people in the Beast Pirates are really uneasy about staying, particularly Apoo and Hawkins. Hawkins is calculating his chance of survival, and notes that Kaidou's presence dramatically tilts it in their favor. Mulling on this, he wonders when would be the right time to steal the Eternal Log Pose. Apoo is especially aware he has total control of the speaker system, and so he is in a unique position to cause chaos.

As a note, I think it's weird Apoo's powers only affect those that can hear. He can clearly affect explosions onto objects or locations that _cannot_ hear. I think it's better that his powers "actualize" the effects, meaning, the sound "creates" the effects, rather than the other way around. Therefore, the louder the sound, the more powerful the effect; the longer the sound, the longer the effect. It would work in the same way Robin's Flower Woman abilities work.

Obviously, X Drake defects.

So the game is set: the Pacifistas and the marines are trying to break through the bay past the Beast Pirates' main forces, while our heroes are attacking from the back, with the samurai acting as a rear guard for Gifters and Waiters and everyone else heading into the palace. Throughout this, Usopp and Franky continue their bombardment along with the marines, ripping open the top of the palace, allowing the moon to penetrate into the hall causing the minks to transform. Thus the Headliners and Awakened Zoans have a lot on their hands.

Also, Franky shows off the General Franky. Kid looks on stoically - he seems to be too mature for that kind of stuff. But it's then revealed that Kid creates an even _bigger_ robot out of jealousy.

Sasaki leads a troop of armored Gifters to attack Franky and Usopp's position. They have their little battle, but the note is that they jump from ship to ship, trying to sink each one so no one has anywhere to run away to (which would lead Usopp to retort, before getting headbutted to oblivion, in his typical fashion).

Upon encountering the Kid Pirates, the Marines are unsure of what to do. Yes, they hate the crew of an Emperor of the sea, but they hate Kid's crew even more, for his taking of human life. Kizaru focuses on Kid specifically; a vice admiral - maybe Onigumo - fights Killer. Kid, as much of a grudge he has against Kaidou, leaves him for Luffy, as he likes the idea of fighting Akainu himself and destroying the marine ships (he's never seen Buster Call ships before and wants to play with them).

Akainu himself ascends to Kaidou's bedchamber - I like the idea of him using something mundane like a carpet, then using the heat generated from magma to lift himself up. Akainu is just about to take the Log Pose when Kaidou himself knocks him out. Akainu tries to cover him in magma, but Kaidou laughs.

"Shurororororo... it was a shame what you've done to Fire-fist Ace. Did you think you could put out my fire?!" before blasting Akainu away, setting Onigashima on fire.

Kaidou and Akainu fight on the roof-top. Kaidou sees the carnage going on below. "This must be a sorry sight...World's Strongest Creature! Your crew will be destroyed tonight!" Kaidou cries, then laughs, "What a stirring tribute to me! What a masterpiece in my eyes! I am glad the heavens have allowed me to live for so long. Tonight is a beautiful requiem...! If only songs like this could go on forever!" We then get a little bit of his backstory: we see especially his dream of creating a world of only war, ruled by the strong.

Akainu, ironically, says, "You're sick!" Kaidou says, "This is how the world has always been! This is how it must be! If you wish to call me 'sick', then defeat me, _then_ say so!" Aokiji steps in. "He's right. You _are_ sick. I would have never thought I would hear you say those words, Sakazuki." (Aokiji can be foreshadowed freezing CP0 agents.) They then try to take on Kaidou together.

Luffy and his crew get distracted by the Calamities and the Tobiroppo. Jack leads the fight against the Minks, as he has experience with them.

Early on, Who's Who defeats a CP0 agent, where he brings up that he once was a rival of Rob Lucci's.

Just as everyone is seemingly settled, fighting in large groups, a loud "SHAN" is burst through the loud speakers, the palace is bisected in half; just before anyone can get a sense of what happened, a "DON!" erupts subsequently after. The top of the palace skyrockets, then crashes into a million pieces. (Obviously Nami is miserable by the whole experience.) Apoo to his crew: "That about does it for the speakers! Who would have guessed all three admirals from the Summit War would come all at once? Alright, let's get that Log Pose in Kaidou's possession." "Captain, where even is Kaidou's room in all this?" Stunned. "Oh." The funny thing about this gambit is that everyone's eyes are now on Apoo.

So everyone in the palace is separated. Some parts of the palace are intact - for example, we still have Black Maria's interaction with Sanji, Robin and Brook, because she was either in the upper or lower levels, your pick. I may want to steal Brook for a fight with Apoo later. Zoro fights King, Sanji (eventually) gets to Queen, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi fight Jack, Jinbe fights Who's Who, Robin fights Black Maria. To be honest I really don't like Page One and Ulti and I'm happy if Nami just works with Jinbe putting out fires. Nami already had a lot to do in Whole Cake Island, how about we give her a break?

Oh yeah, Chopper. Seeing that Chopper didn't really do any doctor stuff in Whole Cake Island, it made sense for Oda to give him that virus to deal with. We can keep the Ice Oni virus - in fact, it's a lot more deadly with berserk Minks running around, right? Maybe Queen extends his neck taller than the entire palace and crushes a capsule in his jaws, thus spreading the gas everywhere like a censer; his using a gatling gun is silly. Queen taunts Chopper with the antibodies, passing them onto a Headliner or a Tobiroppo who is an ancient snake, which means they can crawl on walls and slip through cracks. Chopper, once more, is annoyed that he has to chase his opponents to beat them.

The explosion has thrown off Aokiji and Akainu, who are wounded from their fight with Kaidou. (As a note, they work horribly with each other, bickering the whole time through that their powers don't work and they get in the other's way. Just so people don't over-powerscale this.) Kaidou, who is also wounded, transforms into a dragon and laughs, wondering if anyone can beat him. The Red Scabbards then show up. They fight on sacred ground. Though unexpected, they fight Kaidou admirably, even giving him another scar for his pains using Oden's Two-Sword Style.

Outside, Kid asks Killer a question: Do I have enough Buster Call ships to make a giant robot? To which Killer responds, Mmm, maybe one more. The Kid Pirates have torn the Marines' formation into pieces; they are trying to retrieve their ships, and Kizaru is trying to pin down Kid but, ever since their last fight, he has come up with a plan to counter the admiral. He can increase his polarity dramatically to the point where he can somewhat foil Kizaru's speed (at the cost of making him extremely sick) and he realized that Kizaru is vulnerable to his punches if he uses reflective material like glass. Two of Kaidou's oldest crew, a Glyptodon Zoan and a Megalonyx Zoan, too slow to actually enter the palace for the festivities, make small talk; one chuckles to himself what the Beast Pirates could have been if Kid joined, the other scolding him for praising the enemy. "But the enemy of my enemy is my friend," so they say, helping him rout the marines. It is at this moment Akainu appears and melts down Kid's robot.

The explosion has leveled out the palace's bottom floor, which once served as a massive sumo stadium. Here, Apoo, X Drake, and Luffy, upon learning of a Log Pose to Laugh Tale, fight for Kaidou's treasure. However, they also have to compete with a Velociraptor Zoan, who speedily steals from X Drake's hands. He and X Drake have a comical argument over the nature of their Zoan fruits - how Queen has experimented with Devil Fruits and found ways to maximize their potentials. He does stupid things like shift his head to his hand and makes his body disproportionate, much like Kaku had done. They wrestle, only to realize that dinosaurs have very small arms.

X Drake defeats the Velociraptor Tobi Roppo; the Log Pose ends up in Luffy's hands. X Drake proposes that he and Luffy make an alliance; Luffy innocently agrees, to which X Drake kicks him aside and steals the Log Pose, living up to his epithet "Red Flag". Just as X Drake is about to make off with his treasure, he hears a "DON!"; he uses Shave to quickly dodge the explosion, revealing he knows that there is a delay of one second before his explosions go off. "Very good! But you don't know about every tool in my arsenal, do you?" With this, he plays the flute on his left hand - causing a stabbing effect through X Drake. He goes to Luffy, "Hey, as my ally now, can you get rid of him?" "Of course! Hey, wait!" Luffy says, before X Drake starts running off with the Log Pose, only to be stopped by Hawkins who now finds it auspicious to betray Kaido.

Hawkins' Devil Fruit makes him a Straw Man. That's a bit more than him being merely made of straw; I'm not sure if the meaning of the phrase is lost in Japanese, but in English a straw man is a way to draw attention from the true point of an argument. Hawkins already has the ability to redirect damage to another person, and he can create a giant straw demon out of his body, distracting attention from himself. Since Hawkins had a relatively high bounty when he arrived at Sabody Archipelago, I assume he was able to use his abilities to evade detection from marines and possibly torture people, to get information.

Hawkins then is a lot like Robin, setting up decoys and traps as he makes his escape from Onigashima. He can also make clones a la Cracker. Luffy would be chasing him around. Maybe another Tobiroppo or Headliner also chases him around, perhaps a Monkey-like Zoan (Gigantopithecus) or, perhaps to foreshadow Luffy's transformation, a Human Zoan known for its agility, like a Yeti (in which case, you can have some weird humor from the "hybrid" form). Eventually Hawkins defeats the Tobiroppo and makes it upon his ship, which is ready to set sail. However, Luffy pulls the ship back with his absurd superhuman strength, at which point Apoo jumps on Luffy's arms and destroys the ship's masts. Hawkins tries to fix the ship with straw and nails as he does battle with Luffy and Apoo - admirably holding up for a while, using some clever tricks to switch Luffy's consciousness with Apoo's, but losing at the end. The ship does set out a little bit, over a moonlit lake; the Devil Fruit users are stranded. Hawkins, as a last gesture of resentment, throws the Log Pose overboard.

This gambit would have worked if Apoo were not a Tone Man; he uses his piano teeth to kick the Log Pose higher and higher in the air (the piano creates invisible steps), and almost catches it before he is knocked out by Luffy. This is however the same moment X Drake brings in his crew to surround Hawkins' boat, and demands the Log Pose be surrendered. Luffy refuses, and proceeds to smash up Drake's fleet. (Perhaps we see some expert strategizing by Drake here, as he had once been a rear admiral.)

The samurai have gravely wounded Kaidou; they too are wounded heavily too. Kaidou's dragon form lies in a pool of blood. "You are no match for our resolve, Kaidou! You will die here, by Kozuki Oden's hand!" "Shurorororo... You are strong! My wounds pulse with joy! But let me ask you something... How many scrapes with death do men have in a lifetime? One? Two? Do you think I would be regarded as the strongest creature if I had not been in states like this, _many_ times, and still stole triumph in-between my jaws? These wounds you have given me are but leaves on a venerable tree. Let me tell you samurai: don't speak of death until death arrives!" With this he rises up, reinvigorated, defeating the Scabbards.

Luffy has destroyed much of X Drake's fleet, but he's unable to defeat Drake himself, who is incredibly tough thanks to his unique Zoan fruit. We also learn Drake has swallowed the Log Pose - he is confident there is no place where it is more protected. At this, Apoo, recovering, sets Luffy aside. "Listen... I am a Tone Man. Do you understand? The smallest and biggest things know tone. From ants to elephants... Let me show you." Apoo plays the flute of his left hand; silence, then Drake's stomach growls, revealing a bowel movement. X Drake runs to a bathroom; Luffy believes his Devil Fruit must be the strongest of them all.

X Drake comes out with Log Pose in hand, warning his fellow Worst Generation to never try a stunt like that again. It is at that moment a shadowy figure breaks Drake's last ship in half with their kanabo.

It is revealed that after the palace crumbled, Yamato was freed from his cell in the upper levels. (If we want, to establish Yamato earlier, he can be seen fighting Akainu, which seems to be a somewhere-equal fight.) He grabs the Log Pose, points to Luffy as if saying "You want this?", only to be knocked out by X Drake; he then beats X Drake unconscious and takes back the Log Pose with a smile on his face. Yamato and Luffy talk, and he reveals that he wants to be like Oden.

At this moment Kaidou, having dispatched of the samurai, enters, hearing his son's subordination. "Yamato, you are not Oden! You were meant to be the King of Demons! Give me my Log Pose, now!!" Luffy nods at him, and Yamato destroys the Log Pose. "A man who relies on cheap shortcuts can't be the Pirate King!", so Luffy says.

Kaidou is beyond depressed. His son is rebelling against him once more, there are no more samurai left to challenge him, and his plans have been completely ruined. But if nothing will go my way, I will make it work myself! He pierces his tail to the bottom of the island and throws it up into the air. (Luckily Franky saw this and shot the Sunny onto the island on time.) He then blows flame clouds beneath it, lifting it up and sending it towards Wano. "I've always wanted to do this! I've gotten too soft and mired myself in the thoughts of the little. SMILE this, SMILE that. They only worked some of the time, anyway! I'm going to erase this whole island from my memory. No, wait, it's still useful to me as a hideout. Never mind, I'll just get rid of everyone living on it."

Obviously, Luffy is so angry at the thought that he punches Kaidou, starting the final battle. Aokiji and Akainu finally talk: "This is what your Absolute Justice has led to," Aokiji says. "Evil needs to be extinguished," Akainu grunts, "I cannot let Kaidou nor Straw Hat Luffy get away!" "Millions of people are going to die! Are you going to sacrifice them so you can capture two pirates?" "What do you propose we do?" "Come on," Aokiji says.

Akainu and Aokiji make a surprise appearance at the Sunny, which Franky and Usopp make a pathetic attempt to protect. Aokiji asserts the Sunny is the only vessel onboard the island that can safely disembark to Wano. He wants the Straw Hats to help them get to the Flower Capital so they can slow the descent of the island, very similar to what they did in the Summit War against Whitebeard's quake. The Straw Hats agree.

The original fights from the manga - Zoro's, Sanji's, Robin's, Jinbe's - are reaching their normal end. Apoo and X Drake are moving towards the Marines' half of the island, thinking they can steal a marine vessel when the island eventually lands. Apoo, vengeful towards the Straw Hat and wanting to stir trouble, encounters Brook. They argue over who is the greatest star among the Longarm Tribe; Apoo becomes his final form, a band. The two have a true battle of Attack Music. Meanwhile, Drake fights Marine vice-admirals and Pacifistas on his way to the battlefield with the Kid Pirates.

Kizaru is fighting Kid; the admiral would not have made it to his position if he were unable to defend against a few tricks. In his annoyance, he kicks Kid around the island a few times, punching holes through Onigashima from his sheer strength. At this point, Kid can reveal his awakened ability, which would lead to a fun chase sequence where Kizaru is trying to run away from a massive amount of scrap. I'm not sure how Kid wins this one, to tell you the truth, but given the absurdity of his abilities it may not be hard to believe.

You know, something else to add - Chopper should probably interact with someone who also accessed technology like the Rumble Balls, who is also not Black Maria. I mean, gotta wring out the whole Zoan gimmick.

Aokiji and Akainu stare at the descending island; ice would not work, as Kaidou's flame clouds would (as demonstrated earlier) melt it down; magma _could_ work if it was okay to destroy the entire capital; they decide to replicate the same feat as they had in Marineford: block the island's descent with sheer Haki alone, just as they blocked Whitebeard's assault.

With the Beast Pirate forces dwindling, the Marines and the samurais/minks are slowly meeting each other. They're hesitant to fight each other; for the Marines, they're technically innocents; for the samurai, they're foreigners; yet Hyogoro immediately starts cutting up Pacifista. "We were outlaws to begin with - we refuse to switch one tyrant for another! Tell this to the world: so long as the samurai stand for Wano, it shall be free!" With this the tired fighters cheer and repulse the Marine forces.

Momonosuke still has his regular character arc here, where he successfully counters Kaidou's flame clouds with his own, opting not to have his beloved country protected by foreigners alone.

I genuinely enjoy Jinbei's feat of dousing the island's flames, which would have came about from Kaidou's breath and Akainu's magma. Since Kawamatsu is also a wrestler, perhaps he too could also help out (maybe his sword style is based off of using water?). And then Kinemon has the ability to cut fires in half, so...

Perhaps the Marines are willing to make one last push, filling a Buster Call warship with explosives and steering it into the heart of the palace, hoping to blow up Luffy and Kaidou (fitting, for Akainu's philosophy of "Absolute Justice" - and, to tell you the truth, despite the lives lost, even I would think it would be the right thing to do, if you genuinely believe Kaidou and Luffy are the worst things in the world). Yamato would be key in stopping this.

Luffy loses, and Kaidou is unleashed to stop the remaining fighters on the island. Impressively he does so, not without getting some more scars for his troubles. After the battle has died down, and he is sure Wano is about to be destroyed, he quietly heads to his favorite outside bath to soak; the water turns crimson from the blood leaking out of his wounds. He hears a laughter in the skies: Luffy comes back, as Nika. The end.

I understand the whole Nika thing is controversial but, to be honest, I kinda like it. It's at least visually different from people punching each other all the time. Yes, it's stupid that Luffy needs to unlock another "Gear" mode to beat the big bad guy. Yes, it's stupid that the Rubber Fruit was something else this whole time and no one mentioned it or even feared it until now (in fact, there was an even bigger stir about Luffy being Dragon's son than a Rubber Man). But "One Piece" has never really been clever - what seems like clever tactics required massive amounts of materials and massive amounts of work to make them work, more than would be feasible or undetectable (see: the "invincible" detractable walls of Marineford). "One Piece" is interesting because Oda has lots of weird creative ideas for it that work out visually. Luffy's whole Gear 4 thing was kinda stupid because it wasn't interesting; Luffy just hit things harder and faster. Really the only thing I dislike is the change in hair and eye color, which may be going _too_ far in cartoony territory. The Nika thing works thematically because Kaidou is always talking shit about battle, battle being good for people, that dying is awesome, blah blah blah and then Luffy is literally beating Kaidou to a pulp and laughing at him, which is kinda messed up but works for the most messed up man in the world.

Aokiji smiles at Luffy's victory over Kaidou. Exhausted, the unusual duo fall to their knees; lifting an island through Haki alone is no ordinary feat. However, just as Aokiji slumps over, he sees Akainu soldiering on, and calls for his name before collapsing.

Our heroes are carrying the sleeping Luffy away from the battle scene. Akainu comes across them. Everyone draws their weapons. Zoro notes, "Even if you are a marine admiral, there's no way you can beat all of us in your state. Are you truly willing to die over one man...?" Akainu: "There is...no living or dying in justice! Justice demands Straw Hat's head!" At the moment, Kizaru bonks Akainu in the head; he falls unconscious. When asked to explain his actions, he says, "Losing a fight with a Yonkou to another pirate crew is a lot of paperwork. Losing the fleet admiral of the marines in the process, is a lot more paperwork. I don't feel like doing anything today." He walks off with Akainu in toll.

(You could have a funny scene where Fujitora calls Akainu and tells him he can't step forth on the luxury island he is on at the moment until he brings Luffy and Law to him.)

Yet Borsalino's shrug causes the Marines massive problems in the future: in a major conflict determining who is Emperor of the Sea, Kaidou lost, and the Marines essentially granted the crown to Straw Hat Luffy. This is no Whitebeard War, where the Marines, bruised and bloody, were not beaten; this is total embarassment. This fulfills one of Doflamingo's predictions: blood rains on the day after Kaidou's defeat, with people defecting from the World Government left and right.

Something funny that could happen is that Kaidou could come out of the volcano and swear off violence forever. He becomes a nonviolent chaplain who uses violence to teach people lessons.

<a href="/one-piece-rewrite-conclusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And now to the conclusion.</a>

---

On Zoans. They get the short end of the stick when it comes to powers. I think when the concept was first introduced, one thought it would be quite powerful as an eater could develop skills beyond human limits - but after every character gradually exceeded human limits, particularly with Rokushiki and Haki, it seems somewhat pointless.

I always liked the idea that Zoans are really shapeshifters more than anything, much like Kaku's "Pasta Machine" and "No Weak Spots", or Chopper's transformations, or the Minotaurus. (Apparently, Tamago's Devil Fruit is a Zoan, which is also rife with innovation.) I think that aspect ought to be emphasized; I loved the dinosaur jokes, where Sasaki turned the triceratops' frill into a helicopter blade, or King used the Pterodactyl's head like a slingshot. Page One, whose character design I generally dislike, could have used the Spinosaurus' dorsal sail like a revolver barrel - he could even have a sniper battle with Usopp. Ulti could have distributed her body mass like Kaku, into a gourd or make her head and neck into a mace. For the Velociraptor Tobi Roppo suggested above, I like the idea that he can be a "Velociraptor-Centaur" while he's running. Really, unlocking Zoan transformations could have been Queen's major scientific contribution to the Lineage Factor or whatever it is.
