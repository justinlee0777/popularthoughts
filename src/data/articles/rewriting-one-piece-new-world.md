Happy 48th birthday, Oda.

Here we go on the quixotian task of rewriting the Straw Hats' adventures in the New World.

As flawed as I think the story in Fishman Island was, for the reasons I shall list below, I do understand its unique placement in the series, particularly in showing the crew's newfound competency (albeit largely in punching people in the face).

Having had the requisite...and immense...and existentially trying...amount of time to review our pirates' adventures before and after their two-year separation, I came up with the list of things missing from New World journeys:

1. **Island culture** - Islands have a unique culture and overall image to them. Alabasta is in the desert; Skypiea is in the sky; Water Seven's roads are water; Thriller Bark is haunted. Before the quest formally starts, we get a little introduction to how the island operates and what the particular charm of the island, its geography and its citizens possess. Even the zombies of Thriller Bark have a bit more life in them than the citizens of Dressrosa. Outside of what "One Piece" quote-unquote is "supposed" to be, on a story level it is wise to associate your story with a very strong visual image, so the audience can easily remember things.

2. **Mad dash across the island** - Establishing the island culture is important because the Straw Hats eventually make a mad dash through the island to get to MacGuffin or save X and/or Y. The island alternates being an obstacle and a helper to our heroes. This makes the adventure more fun as the reader is uncertain as to what will happen on the journey. Furthermore, from the story level once more, it is weird if the heroes are...just _there_ with their problems. I want to emphasize too this entry is "mad dash across the _island_", not "mad dash through some bad guys and cliffs and that's it."

3. **Clear objective** - At a given point, it has to be clear what our heroes are trying to accomplish. It's one thing if they're goofing around waiting to stumble into intrigue, it's another thing when they're in the thick of intrigue yet with no clue or, crucially, no way to find a clue as to where to go next. This particularly is the case for Dressrosa wherein Doflamingo drops from the sky and announces "Hello! I am the plot!" before shooting Law in the face. "Got it, we're going on the death train to save Nico Robin." That kind of stuff.

4. **Our heroes** - The Straw Hats have to be the drivers of the action. It's fine if another character is pointing out where to go from the backseat. There are nine/ten characters (Jinbei joining in midway) who all have different perspectives, so it is easy to rotate driving duty.

5. **Comedy** - Not that current "One Piece" isn't funny, but the funniness does not seem to be balanced that well with the drama. A good example are the Straw Hats' disguises as they raid Doflamingo's castle; Luffy's fish costume is a bit funny, but this is undercut by the fact that there is no need for them to be in costumes. The story itself has to support the comedy, which I touched on when <a href="/one-punch-man-manga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">critiquing "One Punch Man"</a>: our heroes are funny because they fix everything, everyone else does not need to be.

I am not rewriting anything about Whole Cake Island because it fulfills all the criteria above and then some. We see how the citizens live, _check_. There is a mad dash to _and_ away from Whole Cake Island, _check_. We are very clearly trying to save Sanji and spare every expense to do so, _check_. That story is perfect.

Having written this list and asking ourselves why Oda veered away from the formula, we get some illuminating revelations:

1. **The island is not an island** - What with Oda expanding the greater world of "One Piece", the island the Straw Hats visit is no longer an island; it is simply an actor on a world stage. Crime syndicates, territories, conspiracies, ancient prophecies, world-destroying devices, you name it, these almost all exclusively exist in the Straw Hats' New World adventures. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. But as a rule, for "One Piece" at least, most of the exposition needs to be from the island the Straw Hats' feet are on; the remainder can be about other things, so long as they are vaguely related to the Straw Hats. Interludes between island stories are your cheats, where you can add any detail you want. Furthermore, exposition relevant to the island must _begin_ and _end_ with the island. It cannot end on a tangent about, say, SMILE, or Reverie.

2. **Be kind, do not rewind** - Oda is trying to develop as an artist. He is actively avoiding a repetition of his earlier work. The stories in the New World are substantially darker - Caesar specializing in chemical weapons, Doflamingo is a bloodthirsty madman - separating them from the Bondesque schemes of Crocodile or the carnivalesque of Thriller Bark. However, his trying to add new flavors to the broth sometimes overcomplicates the story, most notably in Dressrosa, which, in hindsight, gave me incredible trouble. Worse, the structure of the stories - guy's a prick, Straw Hats beat the prick - do not change and adapt to their more provoking elements.

3. **A hint of laziness** - I don't like talking about this one, but I thought about it often while scratching my head on several plot elements. Oda simply got a little lazy. This occurred to me particularly when I had acute writer's block on a plot point. A great example is Admiral Fujitora, who does nothing to stop Doflamingo and even helps the warlord fight the Straw Hats, yet has a change of heart at the end and allows our pirates to leave. Granted, Oda's laziness is somewhat justified as some of the elements he introduces are difficult to work with, especially with the aesthetic of "One Piece".

I had a simple attitude for rewriting this: retain as many characters and interactions as possible, especially keeping cool moments with characters, while adding the necessary elements aforementioned and thickening the character interactions (which are the real juicy bits of the series), and seeing through some of the darker elements without going _too_ overboard. In fact, the best answer to the Admiral Fujitora problem would have been to keep him in the periphery of the story, completely unaware of Doflamingo's sneaky schemes; however, I opted to maintain Oda's vision in the best way I could. I discovered I had some biases in writing, which I will analyze in the post-mortem, but I hope that they are not too glaring to readers or are acceptable.

And if this rewrite does not work for you, that is fine. It was meant to demonstrate something to me, who believes there is at least some science to writing, and it was meant to demonstrate to the audience the possibilities of writing. If it does work for you, then I need to add that it works because of a magic something called _The Miracle of Hindsight TM_. Oda came up with all the ideas, and there was indeed a connective tissue, only it required a _lot_ of effort to repair it to a fluid state. This rewrite indeed took a lot of work, and it's definitely not perfect (Dressrosa will never be truly fixed); I can say it was much harder to do than the <a href="/rewriting-one-punch-monster-association-arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"One Punch Man" rewrite</a>.

---

The crew enter the New World with a pod of whales, who each idiotically have the same scar as Laboon's. (Not going to fight it, just going to move past it.) The Log Pose points to an island; they follow.

On the concept that islands in the New World bear more extreme weather, the island exhibits extreme cold - if Drum Island was inspired by America, then this one is the Arctic. The sea around it rises in smoke, there is thundersnow, and the crew can see "slurpee waves" on shore. Our heroes are constantly assailed by diamond dust and freezing fog.

They attempt to disembark, but are quickly detected by the island's inhabitants.

They are captured by particularly large humans - three times larger than a normal person, but less than half the size of a giant. They are renown for being very hardy, able to survive the extreme temperatures here. They are wary of pirates as they believe they received a deadly disease from them long ago, but let the Straw Hats in. They take them to their village of igloos and reveal they were cured by the doctor Caesar Clown, a good-hearted, bumbling doctor everyone has a funny anecdote about. The good doctor told them that so long as they ate all of their food with a certain powder, the disease will never come back; moreover, the resultant brew is extremely delicious, so they eat everything with the brew, as we see they have tried to eat the Straw Hats by boiling them in it.

However, they currently have a different issue at hand: they are running out of food. The truth is, the island used to be much colder. The rise in temperature has caused local fauna, such as the Giant Boar, to migrate slowly to the center of the island which is a massive mountainous region (yes I know this is exactly like Drum Island). The center of the island is easily the coldest in the region, with the weather consisting of extreme storms. Only the most experienced of the island's rangers have attempted to stake out the area, but they have not returned; however, the doctor Caesar is said to live there, using his vast scientific knowledge to make it hospitable. As they foster a culture of self-sufficiency, they don't believe in living in Caesar's cushy castle, though they respect him as they believe they who enter the crown of the mountain attain enlightenment. In fact, they send some of their children to live with Caesar if they become extremely sick; they have received letters from them showing they are okay, and furthermore showing that Caesar teaches them all sorts of useful things about medicine. Some people of the village scoff at this behavior, but they don't dare mention that they think the sick children should have died.

Chopper wants to meet the doctor. Luffy wants to go as well. Sanji wants to get his hands around the local fauna for cooking. Nami, very clearly remembering the events of Drum Island, initially does not want to go but realizes that, if the mountain contains the most amount of magnetic activity, the Log Pose will reset faster upon arriving there. Reluctantly she decides to go, the irony not lost on her. She may also be concerned about the missing children, wanting to return them back to their parents. When the villagers mention that on the opposite side of the island is a community of reformed criminals, Franky also decides to go to help repair some of their equipment.

The Straw Hats go on their way to adventure. We see large hairy creatures, the size of the villagers, awaken and pick up their rifles, hunting the Straw Hats.

Meanwhile, Vice Admiral Smoker and his crew have arrived at the island. Vice Admiral Vergo, a well beloved Marine, has dispatched a signal for Smoker's assistance. Smoker decides to split his crew into two: Smoker will head to Vergo's side of the island and Tashigi will lead a crew to the other side, so as to cover the island thoroughly in case of emergency. Smoker is suspicious about something: though there hasn't been official evidence, he suspects boats originating from Dressrosa, Warlord of the Sea Doflamingo's base of operations, have been coming in and out of this island.

Tashigi quickly finds the Thousand Sunny and disembarks, confronting Zoro. Tashigi and Zoro argue about how they keep running into each other and why Zoro refuses to fight Tashigi, only for the Straw Hats to mop up the rest of Tashigi's crew in the background. Clearly she can't win alone, so she decides to sit in with them and wait for Smoker to come with Marine back-up. Zoro scoffs and tells her to do whatever she wants. Robin looks at Brook knowingly, to which Brook only responds "Yo ho ho." (An alternate way for this to end is for an actual fight to erupt between Zoro and Tashigi, but neither of them are willing to finish it. This may be more fitting for her character considering the end of Alabasta.)

Smoker sees Vergo standing in the midst of corpses: all of the ex-criminals have mysteriously died, without any external injuries. He also notices that the criminals have bizarre limbs, looking animal-like. Vergo, with tears in his eyes, promises revenge on whoever did this. Vergo has a secret to reveal to Smoker, asking him to follow him.

The Straw Hats encounter a single, injured Boar on their path to the mountain. Chopper closes in to treat its wounds. Suddenly, shots are fired from the distance. The gunmen resemble Yeti. Luffy mysteriously falls unconscious. Subsequently, in panicking over Luffy, Franky and Sanji also slump over.

After analyzing the situation, Chopper concludes that the brew they consumed was actually a drug - they are experiencing extreme withdrawal symptoms as their bodies have metabolized the drug faster, as they have higher fat percentage in their bodies. Luckily, Chopper was in his Brain Point.

Though they are in the midst of enemies, Chopper is horrified at the thought that the villagers must suffer even worse withdrawal effects, and that the hunters are using wounded animals to lure them.

Chopper argues with himself, saying doctor Clown must not know that his "medicine" has horrible side-effects. A doctor is a good person at heart, he reasons. Nami says nothing.

Nami notes with pithy that the situation is reversed: they are the ones who have to carry Sanji and Luffy.

The Yetis eventually pin down the Straw Hats by using the defenceless crew as bait, tranquilizing them.

When they awake, they find themselves restrained in a completely dark room. A solitary individual in a white lab coat and mask brings out all kinds of horrifying implements to experiment with. When Franky comes to, he cries and looks at his changed form: he is now a dwarf with hair and hooves. He has been given Chopper's body. (Sanji and Nami are clearly shocked as well.)

The doctor removes his lab coat and mask, muttering how the appearance of the Straw Hats is untimely - or, perhaps, perfect. In any case, he needs more time. His doorbell is heard ringing over and over again.

At his door he sees Vergo and Smoker. Smoker is shocked to see that Warlord of the Sea Trafalgar Law, the Surgeon of Death, resides here.

A quick note on Law's characterization: I've observed that Law is almost entirely stoic in the New World, as a kind of foil for Luffy. This is OK, though Law is a D, and he smiles quite a bit, if sarcastically, in Sabody Archipelago. I feel like Law is also someone with a "screw loose", enjoying the blood coming from battle or an operation. That would make him interesting and notable.

Law immediately recognizes Vergo, but says nothing; Vergo also keeps up the charade. (This is for our own internal notes; this is not shown in the manga.) Vergo lashes Law, saying he _must_ know about the dead criminals, as he performed surgery on them. Law confesses he has no idea what he is talking about, and that, for inhabitants of the New World, they themselves should have been careful of any unknown disease or fauna. However, as he is now a "government dog", he will happily allow the two in.

Smoker gives in first. Vergo knocks him out immediately.

Law: What underhanded means. That is just like you... Donquixote Pirate, Vergo!

Vergo: White Chaser Smoker... you were getting pretty close to finding out about the SMILE. Your chase ends here!!...

The Straw Hats were operated in several different rooms. Luffy and Chopper happened to be located in the same wing of the facility. They quickly find each other - I guess it would be funny if Luffy was in Franky's body, as he loves robots but is too stupid to figure out how to operate it; Chopper would be in Luffy's, as I still want Franky to be in Chopper's. The two go on an adventure, eventually meeting Monet, who introduces them to the ever-buffoonish Caesar Clown. (Caesar wants to drop the act and kill them, but Monet convinces him to use them as test subjects, seeing as this was Law's intent as well.)

Caesar gives them a tour of the lab, showing he has created miniature biomes so he may better study epidemiology through them. The duo are, of course, highly impressed. Eventually they see a Wano biome, with only the torso of a samurai in it. The two are horrified, but Caesar explains that the samurai are local fauna in Wano, and he is testing that subject's durability to disease. As they see, the samurai torso is extremely resilient and is able to defend itself just fine. "That was a close one!" Caesar thinks.

Nami and Sanji meet one another. Obviously, comedy ensues. They quickly find the villagers' children, who, among other children, have been subjected to gigantification research. She warns the kids, based on Chopper's earlier diagnosis, to stop eating the "medicine" Caesar has been giving them, saying it will make them even more sick.

Caesar arrives at the end of the tour, which happens to be a rollercoaster. Obviously our duo agrees. They get strapped into shackles of seastone. Luffy would break out, if Caesar didn't de-power him (by using electricity or maybe by taking out the Cola, which Luffy was bragging about during the tour). Chopper realizes Caesar is a fraud, and Caesar, at the verge of bursting out laughing at his naivete and unable to resist gloating, decides not to sedate them just yet and show them who he really is.

Caesar reveals he had been a partner of Doctor Vegapunk and specializes in weapons. Devil Fruits, gigantification, chemical warfare, you name it, he has done it. It's always useful to have Devil Fruit users to do vivisection on, and Franky's unique physiology intrigues him. This island's extreme weather and the villagers, their resilience to all forms of disease and their stupid beliefs in their strength, make it the perfect location to surreptitiously conduct experiments, though the amount of exhaust created from the work done is severely affecting the island's climate. Truth be told, the deadly disease that decimated the villagers did not come from pirates, who were actually trying to help, but from the defrosting of the island and thus its deadliest viruses which have survived for centuries. However, the villagers have outlived their usefulness: they are beginning to step closer and closer to his castle. He has collected enough data on them and is about to create his ultimate weapon. The attack on the criminals' colony was a test run.

Caesar rounds up Luffy, Chopper and Smoker into a cage, showing them a video feed of the village. At the same time, many interested parties in the underworld are watching as well. Caesar regales them with a tale: the villagers of this land are among the most resilient people in all of the seas. He has poisoned and infected them with all kinds of materials that would have killed many others several times over, but they have survived and shrugged it off. Now he was going to demonstrate the effectiveness of his new weapon: a gas that will make any victim, of any size and any body, choke to death. The winds in this island, which travel everywhere in less than a day, will be perfect for carrying this toxin.

Zoro, Robin, Brook, Usopp and Tashigi are "hanging out" when the villagers notice the winds are a different color. The sentry is immediately upon contact covered in an ashy shell. The villagers begin to run, assisting our heroes along the way; they have an intimate connection with the island, so they know where the wind often travels. They climb up the mountain, using their advanced survival and hiking skills to traverse it (sometimes to comedic effect). Eventually they come across an extremely wide chasm bridging the land to the mountain. They band together to save our heroes, but they themselves fall into the abyss - as they say, "The mountain chooses who is worthy to step foot on it." This of course upsets our heroes.

Our heroes are surprised by the giant castle within the mountain. The gas is about to reach them. Zoro, who had an arm and a leg infected, wonders, "Does a man's body need to be whole in order to follow the way of the blade?" before cutting open the castle gates with Wado Ichimonji. He then hobbles into the castle with one leg, the rest following him.

Obviously, Caesar did not anticipate this at all.

The facility runs riot. At the same time, Franky off-screen has turned Monster Point and destroyed most of the facility's arms productions. He reverts back and lands in Robin's arms, so we can have the pretty amusing "Don't ever make that face on Chopper again" moment later on, as the Straw Hats will be running across Caesar's biomes trying not to get killed by his pets. They will encounter the samurai torso and reconnect it back with the head and legs, which were in other biomes, fixing Kinemon.

Chopper and Smoker are running around, looking for cola to restore Luffy. (Off-screen, Law has released them from their restraints. We do not know yet he is a good guy. He is using the panic of the moment to run to the SMILE production and destroy it. Smoker says, "I can't believe _he_ of all people helped us free!" It will be revealed later that Law did not return them back to their previous bodies as he needs a "helper".) They encounter Caesar, who blames our heroes for causing this accident, _somehow_. Smoker tangles his smoke body into Caesar's gaseous body, causing a diversion; when Luffy comes to, he reveals he figured out one of Franky's functions. He farts Caesar away with the Coup de Boo.

Law "fights" off the invaders, singling out Zoro. He states that, despite his expertise in Devil Fruit, he must earn his board with Caesar as his security officer. Law is also an aficionado of swords; he reveals his own katana is cursed. He surprises Zoro momentarily with his style, using his knowledge of surgery, but Zoro is the better swordsman. Law shrugs, "Yeah, I'm not much of a swordsman anyway," and cuts up his opponents with his hands, as he is an Operation Man. He lives up to his epithet as the Surgeon of Death. (Law will then run past the intruders and make his way into the SMILE production, further confusing his "enemies".)

Our heroes reunite with Nami and Sanji (surprised as they are by the irony of their swap). The kids begin experiencing extreme withdrawal, with Monet tempting them with "medicine".

Let's stop for a moment and talk about how Monet barely has a purpose in the original story. I'm not sure what to do with her, as it's not clear how her objectives change as a result of this riot. Let's work backwards from the problem, starting with a minor detail of her character: her appearance. Let's say she actually did need the wings and legs Law attached to her - let's say she acted as a quadruple-amputee spy of Doflamingo's, using her disabled status to garner sympathy from unsuspecting people. Maybe she had willingly given those limbs as a sacrifice for Doflamingo's life.

I don't know if Caesar and Doflamingo have so close of a professional relationship. Caesar could be an independent consultant, but it is clear Doflamingo is his biggest buyer; as a result of their partnership, Vergo is set to protect Caesar. _However_, Caesar does not know his secretary, Monet, is also a Donquixote Pirate. She was recommended by an uncommited third party as an extremely diligent woman without a past. Monet's job is to control Caesar's focus - he has multiple buyers for multiple projects, particularly Big Mom's interest in gigantification, but Monet continuously redirects his interest and therefore energy towards SMILE production with arms production as a tight second. She also manages the Big Mom Pirates' ever-frustrated demands. As Doflamingo wants Kaidou to pull over Big Mom in an arms race, she monitors the experimented children herself and allows them to die (not that Caesar is keen about their lives himself).

Monet's abilities as a Snow Woman never made thematic sense to me. It is odd Doflamingo wasted Logia abilities on, well, a spy, and did not hand it over to say Gladius or Diamante (my head-canon says his crew has Devil Fruit abilities thanks to his illicit dealings over any other reason). Monet doesn't really need abilities in the first place, as least not in this rewrite - my guess is that, in the original, Oda intended for Monet to be a mysterious cryptid resident to the tundra, but the concept falls flat because the world outside the lab and the world inside are two completely different worlds, and Monet never really leaves the lab except to watch out for new arrivals _for some reason_.

Though I do like Zoro cutting her in half (harmlessly - to an extent), it is fine if the effect is in her mind only, and not in reality. There is something visually interesting about a quadruple amputee - I guess Law can undo his ability, somehow - manuevering machinery to fight Zoro, so let's say that is what shall happen for this rewrite, as I do not have a better idea currently.

Mocha, one of the largest kids and native to the island, tries to save the day by stealing it away from her friends. The kids in their pursuit trample everyone who is regular-sized, showing they have forgotten who their true allies are.

Tashigi, incensed after hearing Nami's explanation, does battle with Monet, but Monet quickly overpowers her. Zoro then has his famous "Do you think a dog will _never_ bite?" line, seemingly cutting Monet in half, even while he himself had been chopped into many pieces.

Law is stopped by Vergo in the SMILE production room. Doflamingo, who is on the phone, taunts Law, stating how transparent it was when Law joined Caesar. It was almost clear from the start he was trying to get his hands on SMILE. Yet, just as Doflamingo is being attacked by Baby 5 in Dressrosa, Doflamingo says he will forgive him - "I forgive anyone who is family!" Law then grits his teeth and asserts this is a matter beyond family; or, this stopped being about family a long time ago, when Doflamingo commited an unforgivable act (which is the murder of his brother).

Doflamingo laughs and reminds Law of when Vergo viciously beat him, and how it is impossible for him to forget the pains of this memory. He also knows that Law needs a "helper" - he cannot win anything without a little bit of assistance. Vergo does indeed get the upper hand in the beginning, until he notices a bit of smoke entering the room. With Smoker's help - perhaps by using the specific properties of Smoker's body as a Smoke Human - he defeats Vergo and cuts the SMILE room in half.

Chopper, who has never figured out Luffy's abilities at all, is using his body's rubberness to retrieve materials and papers quickly to devise a cure for Caesar's ultimate weapon. He encounters Momonosuke and wonders at this strange gecko ("I'm a dragon!"). He asks Momo to fly around and look for equipment, but Momo reveals he can't fly; however, he did overhear where Caesar did his research. Later on, when Momo formally meets Luffy, Luffy will ask, "Who are you?", which will be pretty funny.

Caesar taunts Chopper, giving his whole speech on how this island is just like gas: it seems like it is not there though it is. The true name of the island is Punk Hazard; it does not matter what the locals call it. As far as he feels, they are not even there.

Caesar: Knowledge is power! Joker will create me another facility, no problem. I have the recipe for the gas in my head. And I'll be pumping artifical Devil Fruits in the market in no time. Even my gigantification research will bear fruit. You've seen those giant kids in one of the monitors, didn't you? You know how the drug's side effects intensify based on body size? The next time one of those kids eat their 'candy', they will die!! That'll be one more body to provide me valuable data!

Of course this infuriates Chopper. Mocha has sacrificed herself to save the others, by eating the candy and dying as a result of it.

Chopper raises his fist. "That? You fool! Unless you know _haki_, you might as well punch the air -" He swings his fist against the wall, using Luffy's herculean strength to break it and expose them to the extreme colds of the mountaintop. "Any type of gas will solidify if its environment is cold enough!" "Shu ho ho!... That seems clever, but take a look at your friend's body! Even flesh and blood would snap like twigs frozen by this air! What do you think will happen to rubber?" "Luffy will be king of the pirates! As his doctor, he has entrusted me with his body from the beginning! It's not whether he trusts _me_, it's a matter of whether I trust him!" Chopper beats the crap out of Caesar, though pushing Luffy's body to the breaking point.

Law encounters the Straw Hats, half of whom have been infected by the gas as a result of trying to restrain the children. Sanji and Nami demand he swaps them back but he rebuts, "There's no time! Don't you see there's life-killing gas?" He sees that they're trying to escape while carrying the subdued children with them. "I swear, pirates helping others for free? Do the Straw Hats have no shame?" When they retort that he is a monster for assisting in hurting children, Law scoffs at them. "Hurt them? I'm the only one who knows how to cure them." This is when Nami begs Law to save Mocha, who is in the process of dying.

Law calls for his assistant, a Stand Woman (the only real new addition to Punk Hazard; I like fleshing out Law's crew). Using her abilities, she transforms into a holding stand (I understand there is a Devil Fruit very similar to this already) and pulls out two scalpels for Law to use. "The doctor is in." Law beautifully uses the scalpels like blades, cutting up the child rapidly, decisively and elegantly - witnesses call him a barbarian, but the reality is he is using his Devil Fruit to track the course of the infection and remove the source. Mocha begins breathing steadily, and his assistant, the Stand Woman, passes on the cure to the drug to the remaining Marines so they may help the rest of the children.

Zoro wonders, "Why didn't you use your sword instead of those scalpels? That would have been quicker." Law responds, "Are you dense? Do you think what goes through a child's mind when she sees a sword? A doctor suffers for their patient, not the other way around." (This alludes to Doctor Hiriluk's belief that every doctor has a good heart.)

To tell you the truth, I have no idea how to end the threat of gas. Someone could turn on the ventilation, or the gas could leave the hole Chopper opened up. I'm indifferent at this point without a clear favorite.

It is revealed the villagers have survived the fall, cushioned by snow or sea slush.

The criminals were actually members of the Heart Pirates, playing dead as an elaborate ruse to catch Vergo. The Yetis were also Law's crew; Law had transferred the consciousness of dying people into the bodies of the rangers, who were long dead as a result of Caesar's antics; he transferred the hair because they constantly complained it was cold (as a joke). (I am open to the argument that it is weird for their widows and widowers, though they may find this "reincarnation" fortuitous.)

This is when Law proposes to Luffy they make an alliance. Luffy agrees, to the crew's chagrin.

Baby 5 and Buffalo arrive, blowing away all the gas from the island. (I am indifferent to Monet dying, though I do like her moment with Doflamingo: "Die for me." It just feels excessive for the facility to explode.) It suffices for Usopp and Nami to fight them<a href="#usopp">\*</a>; though I really like Franky's original fight, he's just too far away from the Sunny at this time.

Everyone returns back to the village for a celebration; Sanji is reluctant to eat the boars because the mountain protected them, but the villagers assert that it would be offensive to not eat what the mountain provides. Everyone is enjoying themselves; Smoker remarks that had they met outside of the island, they would have been enemies. Law smiles.

The crews are about to disembark; the marines are returning the kids who have been abducted, Chopper is giving instructions to the children who have returned. Just as Law's feet touch the sea, he and Smoker draw weapons. As Smoker alluded to, once they were off the island, they were enemies again. The Straw Hats appeal to Luffy to stop this, but Luffy refuses - this is a duel between men, to decide their own fate. If Smoker wins, Luffy has no intention of fighting Smoker, but he has no intention of being captured either. Everyone needles him on the obvious contradiction.

Smoker seems to have the upper hand as Law can't touch him, but Law reveals he had a crafty plan: he prepared a glass jar and used his abilities to suck Smoker into it. Just when most of Smoker's body is in the jar, he cuts the head in half and throws the rest of the jar to sea. The marines run to fetch Smoker - Tashigi wonders why he didn't just throw all of Smoker out, as otherwise he opened the possibility for Smoker to locate the rest of his body. "You are too soft for a warlord of the sea." "And you are too weak to be running your mouth at me. Get out of my sight."

Kinemon discusses his history with Momonosuke. Caesar's biome was no substitute: they want to return back to Wano.

Law demands Doflamingo quit his status as a warlord of the sea for the safety of his subordinates. Doflamingo agrees, thus starting a conflict between the Straw Hats, Heart Pirates and Donquixote Pirates.

I'll use this section to expand on specific details which aren't necessary to get right.

<p id="usopp">
Usopp's Pop Greens have never made any sense to me. I think in concept it could be an interesting idea, but in execution the plants can literally do whatever he wants them to do, although they mostly grow. It is possible that Oda may be setting up an interesting interaction with Ryokugyu.

I would prefer if Usopp used insects. He trained in a jungle. He was taught by a man who idolized Hercules beetles. The island was designed for gluttons. Insects can be active predators. It makes for a more dynamic fighting style.

Returning to the Baby 5 and Buffalo fight. Baby 5 and Buffalo are apprehensive as they are outnumbered. Law assures Luffy and co they are a threat. Usopp fires a pellet; it explodes in a cloud. Buffalo scoffs, and blows it away, stating their smokescreen will not work against him. Usopp then reveals that was no smokescreen; he shoots another pellet, which Buffalo easily dodges, only to find out it is a many-bodied caterpillar whose bodies explode, chasing after a scented prey. Buffalo narrowly dodges the caterpillar head, which grows immensely in an act of desperation to eat its prey. Usopp fires several pellets after, missing Buffalo each time. All during this time, Baby 5 transforms into a rocket launcher and a minigun respectively, forcing everyone on the ground to be cautious protecting the children.

At a critical moment, Baby 5 turns into a scythe which Buffalo swings around, throwing our heroes into confusion. In a swift motion, Baby 5 turns into a missile and both dive-bomb towards the Straw Hats. However, their true objective was to distract them; in reality, Baby 5 is the one who rescues Caesar. They make off gloating, only for Usopp to reveal he was not tricked after all. Buffalo finds a praying mantis in his collar.

"Praying mantis?" Zoro says. "<i>Train</i>ing mantis," Usopp answers.

The praying mantis lifts up its arms and performs one of Zoro's Two-Sword Style moves. Zoro asks payment for training lessons. Buffalo tries to fly away, but it is revealed that Usopp's earlier shots were for setting up spiders, who have covered the entire sky with invisible, strong-as-iron threads. Baby 5 explodes Buffalo, and both fall defeated.

In the original story, a dragon is the first creature seen on Punk Hazard; therefore dragons have a prominent appearance in the story, but not a role. It is fine if dragons have been introduced to the island's ecosystem in this rewrite; they are hardy enough creatures. Indeed, the islanders believe their loved ones reincarnate as resilient creatures, and so the image of the dragon is fitting and perhaps even fortuitous, a sign of a new beginning.
