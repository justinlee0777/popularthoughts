I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### Elvis Presley's Suspicious Minds

(113 million views. I'm always impressed when these pre-internet songs have so much attention.)

Bit of a disservice to reduce all of Elvis' shtick to fucking, huh, Baz Luhrmann.

By the way, the moral being Elvis loved his fans too much is also the theme of "Last Dance", the Michael Jordan documentary. These two objects are not alike.

I try to compartmentalize two impulses of mine: that of the artist and the intellectual. I can look at Elvis intellectually and say, Boy howdy, what a _strange fella_. As an artist, I seek, rather aggressively, beauty and only beauty. I let this impulse override the other more often, because I'm primarily interested in observing how (the question is never whether) the art still informs our own lives today. So, of the musician's personas, I take the artist far more seriously than any other persona. The artist can poop their Pampers and I'll still examine their artistic output more than anything, and, frankly, I find it disrespectful to examine anything else. Unless we're talking about R. Kelly, who is a monster. (There's another compartmentalized impulse of mine that finds R. Kelly really, really, extraordinarily funny.)

Maybe Baz Luhrmann's "Elvis" is really good, I don't know, but you can't celebrate a musician without highlighting the music, without capturing the awe and majesty of their music, and those two words are two strong descriptors of Elvis' music. And on the other topic of cultural appropriation, again, I look at the art first, and you can only say Elvis was _influenced_ by the blues. He didn't really steal anything. I think it's fair to be _upset_ about it, in that, it occurs over and over again that black musicians are overlooked and never recognized for what they are, but you can't be _indignant_ about it, as if it were an actual injustice. It's like a bitter irony, a bit of ginger candy you're forced to suck and smile through. Just listen to Elvis' voice to know that, well, he's kind of like the Justin Bieber of the '50s, except with a lot more range. (Well, Biebs may surprise us one day. Actually, touching on Justin Bieber for a bit, the hook of "Ghost" is so nice that it doesn't belong in an EDM song and probably fits better on an acoustic track. It's a bit like Phil Spector producing for Elvis. Or, err, [Leonard Cohen](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Ladies'_Man_(album)>).) He was a sad sack. Elvis was really good at pouting. Blues musicians of yore expressed pain, but Elvis expressed _sorrow_. It was a color he was extremely good at painting. From the titular "Elvis Presley", "Blue Moon" still sticks out as a highlight, and the guy was 22 at the time. Also, chicks dig sadness. I think it's this persona that thrusted him into fame, and he _kept_ fame by expanding the number of dramatic personae he could inhabit. As he got older, he understood more of his own insecurity and frustration toward the world and himself, and so developed an extremely powerful, roof-lifting voice. I'll give the 2022 "Elvis" that credit: I never gave Elvis recognition until I decided to research some of his discography out of frustration with the premise of the film.

The Elvis of his mid-thirties had seen some shit: the death of his mother, the nadir of his career through his film career, and the deterioration of his marriage. This would see the rise of 1969's famed "From Elvis In Memphis", kicking off with "Wearin' That Loved On Look", where Elvis roars "I had to leave town for a little while!" indignant at the "little" when his lover was a lotta unfaithful. We shouldn't encourage the petty in other people, but pettiness in the best of artists is entrancing. His "Baby!" in this song is haunting, claiming a near-supernatural possession over his lover.

That being said, I like Elvis's sad sack songs more, and so I gravitate to Mark James' "Suspicious Minds" which begins with that wonderful, rolling, fluttery guitar. "We're caught in a trap; I can't walk out," Elvis barks - _barks_. That's what it sounds like. Who else can do that? It comes out from his chest, and the words are so molded we almost see the mouth making them, and they make a pitiful expression indeed. Then there's the wailing "Because I love you too much, baby," those elongated au's, ove's and mu's so delicious to behold as if he were trying to sneak another grasp on the woman he loves so much, which makes the succeeding "Why can't you see, what you're doing to me?" all the more poignant.

We can't go on together<br/>
with suspicious minds,<br/>
and we can't build our dreams<br/>
on suspicious minds,<br/>

is sung almost gloriously, with backup singers, as if Elvis believes that the truth, even if painful, is still freeing.

"So if an old friend I know / drops by and says "Hello", / would I still see suspicion in your eyes?" Hell of a rhetorical argument. I particularly love the dance of "o", "f" and "n" in "if an old friend I know". Followed up by: "Wou-u-u-ld I st-eeee-l see sus-pi-shun in yo-u-u-u-r eyes?" giving each vowel in that sentence so much robustness, as if his pain is really bottomless.

Then, juxtaposed next to a jogging beat: "Here we go again, / asking where I've been; / you can't see the tears are real, I'm crying."

After this quickening of the heart, the song slows down and the narrator makes an honest appeal: "Oh, let our love survive, / I'll dry the tears from your eyes, / let's don't let a good thing die, / when, honey, I've never lied to you." Sure. Regardless of this appeal, the music proceeds in an even faster tempo, and Elvis is left muttering "Don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out," depicting his inability to literally walk out of the doubt and anxiety, set to upbeat music. As the cycle of despair continues, the music fades out - evidently a decision by RCA's producer Felton Jarvis - only to come back in force again. Chips Moman, the producer of "From Elvis in Memphis", likened it to a scar. It's definitely an awkward addition, but, on a different mind, it somewhat connotes that these doubts do experience lapses, which may give the audience some hope for our protagonist.

Now we get to the _weird_ part of the conversation: how much the music is true to life. It would be funny if I said "In reality, there was much for Elvis's partners to be suspicious of." But no one seems to know much on the guy's life. So let's flop it; let's look at Elvis in both perspectives, as a despairing, faithful husband and a playboy. For both sides contain truth.

That's what makes Elvis interesting: he had the ability to play multiple angles, even in the sexual "Power of My Love" and mournful "In the Ghetto". After all, sexuality can imply devotion to a single subject, and piety can come from guilt over one's own sin. We can, certainly, shut down and power up certain parts of our personality. "Suspicious Minds" works with any ideation of Elvis - it's a sad song about his inability to control his reputation, whether maligned or deserved. Really the song revolves around two lines: "We can't go on together with suspicious minds", "I can't walk out because I love you too much, baby". It doesn't matter if there is guilt or moral assignation; what matters is that overwhelming fear of losing the person one loves, to forces out of their own control. This describes Elvis's sad songs rather well: despairing over situations he can't control, ever like the bluesman he originated as, with that patina of pitying himself. Which is a quality that made Elvis a little annoying: he was somewhat self-centered and unaware. Well, as everyone is.
