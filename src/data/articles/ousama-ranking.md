There are too many characters in "Ousama Ranking".

I'm not sure if there are authoritative definitions for primary, secondary, tertiary and background characters. A primary character directs the flow of the story and, from that direction, has an arc. A secondary character may have an arc which is largely controlled by the greater story; if they have an effect on the plot, it is replaceable by another character at best. A tertiary character has no arc. A background character hardly has a speaking role.

Gatsby, Frodo, Michael Scott, and Naruto are primary characters. A primary character is analyzed by what they do and what they _don't_.

Daisy, Samwise, Dwight, and Sakura are secondary characters. You don't analyze as much what the characters do _not_ do; in a way, secondary characters are somewhat void of the expectation of freedom primary/main characters have.

Tom, Pippin, Ryan, and Neji are tertiary characters. Maybe Pippin has an arc, but if you got rid of it the story would remain the same.

The guy with glasses, an ent, Ronni, and the ninjas with the claw weapons are background characters. They're not in the background, but they might as well be.

### Ousama Ranking

"Ousama Ranking" is composed of almost all primary characters. At least, they are positioned as primary characters.

Given the above, as a storyteller you need to relegate a proportional amount of attention to characters, because your audience has a limited amount of attention. This is not speaking of intellectual attention; this is largely speaking of _emotional_ attention. There is a limit to an audience's thinking where they can say, "Oh shoot, what's that guy going to do?" or "Oh no, this is a really sad moment for this character."

A story needs characters to support and enhance the main character's arc - because human beings are naturally social characters and bounce ideas off others - so you need to figure out what the right amount of detail is for your secondary characters. That is part of the art form. It's difficult to speak for ideal cases as writing is almost always on a case-by-case basis, but the general trend is that secondary characters often have little history and have some direct emotional connection to the main character, and that's _it_. Going beyond those necessities, you risk the audience fixating on them too much, such that they dilute the emotional impact the audience may have on the main character's arc, which ought to be the juiciest arc.

These are the primary characters in "Ousama Ranking", who ought to be secondary: shadow man, sword guy, spear guy, snake guy, queen stepmom, Prince Daida -

Oh.

### Villains

Villains are a distinct category.

They're difficult to categorize, because their distinguishing character is that they're _villainous_ - they screw things up in the world so badly that the main character has to fix it, and there is something about their character that causes them to screw things up. That's the strict definition. The villain may atone at the end, or they may be killed, it doesn't matter.

A villain stops being a villain when you get rid of that latter requirement: that fundamental, villainous part of their character. If a character simply makes mistakes, but they are in a position of power, they're not really villains, they were just put in unfortunate circumstances that someone else has to correct.

Prince Daida begins as a villain and then, as that ridiculously long father-in-a-cup scene plays out, he stops being a villain and becomes a primary character - because his expulsion of Bojji can be seen as a flawed, but rational, response to the uncertainty of his rule.

Griffith from "Berserk" is pretty much a primary character. Chrollo from "Hunter x Hunter", despite the audience getting substantial insight into him, is still a villain.

Really, you can't give a villain too much backstory or ability to reflect on their actions, or else they lose the villainous quality. Most complex villains have thought out their philosophy thoroughly beforehand and refuse to change because of the inherent strength of their character.

### Back to Ousama Ranking

Back to "Ousama Ranking". Prince Daida, his dad, and the magic mirror are also primary characters. I'm not really sure about Bojji's mentor, so I'll call him a tertiary character as well as his brother, king of the underworld.

So I'm counting ten - adding Bojji - primary characters so far, and so each and every _one_ of them can steal a scene and divert the audience's attention. One basic issue that this causes is that of the age-old nitpick: "Why did that character do that?" Why didn't s/he stand up to this character? Why didn't s/he display mercy? Why didn't s/he change their goals at this revelation?

This is an age-old nerd debate, whose answers span from "Because this character has this loyalty and that inferiority complex to this character..." and "Because the script needed them to do so". I've observed it is fine if a story has one or two of these, but once you start counting them beyond the fingers of your hand you know you have a sloppy script.

Why did the swordsman guy sacrifice Bojji? Do I really expect him to atone for it so easily? Why was the spear guy so unusually loyal to the king, where the other guys weren't? Why didn't the assassin guy save Daida? Why did Daida listen to the mirror in the first place instead of, I don't know, his mother, or his mentor? And there really wasn't anyone outside of the characters we met who said, "Hey, let's not expel or murder this little kid, who is mute, small, and defenseless, and just lock him up in some tower?" You would think if everyone was conscious of concepts such as mercy and empathy, they would, you know, not resort to murder so often? And there are way worse things than murder.

Clarity is a virtue in storytelling. The story demonstrates rather clearly a writer's conviction in their material. Even a sloppily-written story demonstrates the writer's belief, and the weakness of that belief.

You can tell whether a writer is convinced of their own beliefs by analyzing the story. When Dormas, sword guy, breaks down into tears after pushing Bojji off a cliff, you know the writer did not believe that killing Bojji was the right thing to do. But if the writer believes it was wrong, and Dormas believes it was wrong, then who believes it was right? The audience? If no one is convinced of it, then why was it in the story? Prince Daida was forced to host his deceased father's spirit, a decision made by at least three characters - the king, the mirror woman, and spear guy. We the audience feel it is wrong, the writer, given how the scene plays out, thinks it is wrong, but sure as heck a lot of characters think it was the right thing to do. So who's right? Why write things that couldn't convince the person writing it?

I touch on this topic when I analyzed <a href="/der-holle-rache" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozart's "Der holles rache..."</a> The artist must descend into their character's darkness; they must come to an understanding with them, even if they revile them; from this darkness comes meaning.

There is no darkness in "Ousama Ranking", only _mistakes_. Writing about mistakes is far, far more condescending than writing about evil. You may come to an understanding with evil; with mistakes, you patronize the people who make the mistakes. Mistakes are forgivable; they are easily traceable to some flaw, and are therefore rational; therefore they can easily be avoided. There is no acknowledgement of our human nature in mistakes; there is only the science of distinguishing and doing right.

Villains must be villains and heroes must be heroes. Not everyone in a story is a hero, but this suffices because a story is a mapping of reality, it cannot replace reality.

Dormas should have tried to kill Bojji in a way that matched his reluctance; rather than atone immediately, he could have had a separate journey back to the kingdom where his rational and emotional sides rage inside of him, on the merits of killing a child for the sake of the kingdom and the sheer immorality of killing a child. If the king was willing to go so far as to sacrifice all of his children for his survival, then you need to demonstrate that that ruthless pragmatism overwhelms any personal feeling, instead of showing he feels... _kinda_ bad about it. If Desher, the underworld king, is going to invade the kingdom, you need to show in him a kind of rage and bloodlust that accompanies someone who is about to attack a defenseless kingdom.

And I don't even know what to do with Miranjo. A character who lives in a mirror and says vague things to manipulate things is almost not a real character, because she has no stakes in the outside world, unless she exhibited some extreme form of vengeful behavior.

And if Bojji were to save the kingdom, he needs to save it in a characteristically Bojji way. Otherwise, if we are able to imagine another hero in the place of him, then Bojji, our hero, the lynchpin of the entire story, is replaceable, simply another decoration on the story.
