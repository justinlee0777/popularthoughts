I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

You may have noticed this week's was late. That does not mean this one is a substitute for two. That would be cheating, abjectly too. If you are like me, you don't go calendrically; you measure, from last week's date, seven days, and expect there will be an article within that seven-day period. Alter your algorithm a little, and imagine a queue, a queue of articles, wearing spectacles, and cute little bow-ties, and, I suppose, paper bodies corporeally with little legalise written in ink all over them. Thus, take the date of the most recent article and the current date (in units of days), subtract the former from the latter, and apply "modulo 7" (Knuth defines this in a neat way: "x mod y \[is\] the remainder when x is divided by y") to the difference. Add the result to the queue; whatever articles are in the queue, they are intended to be done ASAP, with priority, from 1 being Not Really Urgent to 7 being Catastrophic; Dooming; World-Ending, calculated from the number of days the article is delayed. This is what you should think when I am late.

All to say, instead of writing that funny little paragraph, couldn't I, instead, have made this article less late? Yes, yes, yes.

### 100 gecs' Hollywood Baby

Behold, the article I said I would [never](/best-album-2023) write.

It just seemed like a logical step after the emo arena-rockers, My Chemical Romance.

Because 100 gecs is emo. It's extremely self-deprecating. It also has a sense of humor about itself. It doesn't matter if it's moshable. Same can be said for My Chemical Romance, actually. Let's step aside from "Hollywood Baby", the subject of this write-up, and look at "mememe", whose refrain goes "You'll never really know, know, know / anything about me, me, me". Need I say anything more?

Perhaps that in itself is worthy of inspection, that emo kind of morphs and co-opts other, more popular forms of music constantly, almost as if it seeks to legitimize itself and also to pervert its more sociable alternatives, in the same way the eponymous listener may. To the argument that emo doesn't mean anything, as it can't be fixed to any musical style: lyricism and theming, obviously. This goes way beyond the cynicism and deprecation behind, say, Wire, Nirvana, or Hüsker Dü; this is self-laceration, an exorcism in the form of music. There's something pleasurable in hating oneself. It's fascinating. Perhaps listeners prefer to hate themselves than hate the world, which, in its own odd way, is a noble sentiment.

To add, I think the genre is somewhere around the most interesting musical genre at the moment. Perhaps it's a good sign when no one can safely say what a genre _is_, but can point to you several examples and say, That's what it is. I've personally enjoyed the genre's attempt to crossover the most. I still remember (and listen to) I Love Your Lifestyle's "The Movie" (once again proving that Swedes make some of the tightest music) and Oso Oso's "basking in the glow" (I still think of the perfect swagger in Jade Lilitri's "So what?" in "the view", once in a blue moon). I still find Sleep Token's "DYWTYLM" pretty funny, as a really weird and neat blend of emo and metal. I think it's probably the most fruitful genre for singer-songwriters, probably because we're right in the middle of a self-hating culture, probably some manifestation of our helplessness towards the current state of the world. If I could rattle off the most memorable songwriters in the last five years from the toppest of the top of my head: Mitski, Stefan Babcock (nutty thing to say, but, well, I've said it), ANOHNI, Dave Berman. I'll probably always give Greta Kline (Frankie Cosmos fame) credit for "too dark" on "affirms glinting" (2014) for, like, being my life, man. (It's been almost a fucking _decade_ since I heard that song.)

But I digress: 100 gecs. And "Hollywood Baby", the most song-like of the songs on "10,000 gecs". Really not trying to offend or demean anyone, but: was it 100 gecs' intention to make "white-trash rock"? As in, _really_ self-aware music to the point of being uncomfortable? I think this, if anything, is the reason why 100 gecs has been such a captivating band: regardless of whether Dylan and Laura are in on it, it makes for genuinely fascinating expression.

I think that's Laura Les on the guitar opening "Hollywood Baby", possibly the most electrifying intro to a song in 2023. It has the vibes of Andrew WK's "Party Hard" without the drums, which makes you feel as if the party is already over and Laura is trying to bring the pieces together the following morning. That first, flawlessly-delivered verse, which speeds up towards the end as the panic attack sets in, "What you crying 'bout, baby? / Are you getting lazy? / Clear blue sky but it rains all the late fees. / Did you get the payment? / we had an arrangement, / we don't watch the news, we just read statements."

Then the self-evisceration:

Do you wanna party?<br/>
Malibu Barbie?<br/>
Are you going to PACK THAT SHIT UP<br/>
when it all comes tumbling down?<br/>

which I think is directed to Laura herself, who is a platinum blonde.

The second verse is probably among my favorites of 2023:

Are you looking down the mountain?<br/>
Whatchu crying 'bout, crying 'bout, crying 'bout now?<br/>
Do you buckle under presh-sherrr?<br/>
Come tumbling, tumbling, tumbling down,<br/>

leading to the bridge,

So go pitch your fit, no one gives a shit,<br/>
Better off if you just get over it!<br/>

I love these lines so much. I see the mountain Laura is singing about clearly in my head, wrapped in awe and majesty as the one in Jaimie Branch's "The Mountain"; I also see Laura looking down at Los Angeles, shrunken in the distance, in despair and disbelief. That drawn-out "presh-sherrr" is another idiosyncratic favorite, and sung so emotionally (and yet briefly!) that I feel the pain from when it was - likely - first said to her. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but I wonder if that "presh-sherrr" was an insult once directed to her own Missourian accent. Finally that "Better off if you just get over it!", right as the song is escalating, is sung with such anger, but that anger is pointed at _herself_. It's so weird, and yet it's so triumphant.

Then the mutter, "You'll never make it in Hollywood, baby," sung eight times in a row, growing louder and louder. Wow. Just great.

What's really funny and enlightening about the song is how freeing it is to say the words that possibly caused one so much anger over and over again. Removing them from their context doesn't de-fang them, it just makes the wound hurt all the more, though tenderly. Yet that, too, is a kind of pleasure, the reliving of pain, which is the reliving of life. With pain comes wisdom. Hopefully. Which is to say, "Hollywood Baby" is a nonpareil song about how Los Angeles fucking _sucks and it can suck Laura's dick_. Thus, from pain comes strength, which seems to be where the track's final triumphant "Woo!" comes from. One could argue, at that point, it's not emo, it's the blues. Whatever it is, it's very fun.
