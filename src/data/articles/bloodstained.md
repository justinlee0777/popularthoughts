As the spiritual successor to the "Castlevania" series, which have all been action games, "Bloodstained" is a pretty bad action game.

There is nothing notable about the game's platforming (except maybe in Livre Ex Machina) and you can feasibly farm the Heretical Grinder shard early in the game and spam it on all bosses, until you get Inferno Breath and can spam that. At least enemies scale pretty well with the game's progress, so you still have to mind them.

I've been a big fan of all the RPG-like Castlevania games (starting from "Symphony of the Night") and they're pretty much all solid action games. Some are easier than the others - "Symphony", "Harmony of Dissonance" and "Aria of Sorrow" being the easiest, "Order of Ecclesia" being really darn hard - and some of them have terrible platforming - "Ecclesia" and "Portrait of Ruin" having especially flat levels - but they at least had interesting bosses with interesting attack patterns, who could not be beaten by button spamming.

"Dawn of Sorrow" is probably the best of the pack - it has a selection of pretty good bosses (Paranoia, Aguni, Abaddon) and good levels (clock tower, guest house).

For "Bloodstained's" case, the bosses do get harder from Bloodless onward, but I never really needed to mind any of their moves; since there are plenty of consumables it's fine to take a hit and continue spamming your favorite weapon. (Bloodless, Alfred and Valefar are pretty memorable bosses, but again, you don't have an interesting interaction with them as a player.) Meanwhile, the platforming is jump to the next platform, hit the flying enemy, jump to the next one, open the door, go to the next level, jump to the next platform.

This being the case, "Bloodstained" compensated by focusing on the other, underdeveloped aspect of the RPG Castlevanias: exploration.

In that sense, "Bloodstained" is an improvement over "Dawn of Sorrow" and is the best modern Castlevania to explore. This aspect has actually been neglected in more recent additions of the series ("Portrait", "Ecclesia") - exploring areas, finding items, looting from enemies has never really mattered except to get a little more health, a little more mana, a little more defense and damage. This was a fall from "Dawn of Sorrow" which had a ton of weapons and skills that were all viable with one another and a lot of interesting areas to explore.

I think there are two fundamental improvements from "Dawn":

1. The Luck stat is actually important. I believe in "Dawn of Sorrow" the Luck stat only increased item and skill drop rates by a fraction of a percent; I don't know how it gets calculated in "Bloodstained", but there's definitely a notable difference when the stat gets increased, even when you're farming the hard-to-get items like Orichalcum and the Drain passive shard. Furthermore, it's pretty easy to get equipment to bump up the stat, including O.D's books.

2. When passive shards (skills) have their rank maxed out, they become permanent. Tenacious players can easily get the benefits of shards that increase Luck and gold drop, and even find secret walls and move faster underwater.

In short, the more you invested in farming in the game, the more the game rewards you for your investment. Believe you me, as someone who farmed the Iron Golem's soul in "Dawn of Sorrow", these are huge, huge improvements, that, furthermore, do not constrain the player's build too much.

As a testament to how much I enjoyed farming in the game and getting better equipment, I platinum'd the game on the PS4 - meaning, getting 100% on the item list, which is huge (because of crafting and cooking). I actually found the game pretty relaxing - investing a few hours at a time made substantial progress into the list, and killing enemies is always fun.
