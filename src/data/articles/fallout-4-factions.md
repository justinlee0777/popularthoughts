It doesn't need to be said that the story of the game "Fallout 4" is lacking. I attempt a rewrite of the game by rewriting the factions, whose quest lines lead to the game's ending. I won't restate the story of the actual game, so the article assumes a good level of familiarity with the existing story.

### Minutemen

In the aftermath of the Great War, only one bomb had detonated in the Commonwealth. Unlike D.C. or California, civilization, for the next few days, resumed their normal operations.

For the next few months rule of law was maintained, though there were pressuring factors. The capital of the Commonwealth, Boston, did not venture to make contact with any citizens beyond the Glowing Sea. Given how densely populated Boston was and how few of the population were engaged with food production, there was also the issue of running out of food and water; they would have to begin the process of training folks. When nuclear winter hit, all of these problems ultimately didn't matter.

But before nuclear winter, the state government had an astoundingly simple yet effective idea: set up a system where neighbors account for each other. This acted as an informal census, a kind of civilian law enforcement and a morale booster for the survivors, letting them know that at least someone cared about them in spite of all their troubles.

The snow piled on and on, but people still kept up the habit of visiting each other, even after decades and whatever government had shriveled up from infighting and lack of centralization.

Eventually, there were so far and few habitations and enough lawlessness that the act of visiting one's neighbors was incredibly difficult. The task was left up to a selected group of strong, capable men to check up on various communities, and if need be help things out a bit.

These people, with regards to the state's history, were eventually called The Minutemen.

After the winter, communities began to grow, even prosper again. Families rebuilt and cleaned up unoccupied buildings, crops were cultivated, and water was purified. The coast was infested with Mirelurks, but they had not undergone the evolutionary development that made them so aggressive. There were even plans to send a recon team of Power Armored people past the Glowing Sea to see what was up with New York City.

This would never come to fruition. What came out of the Glowing Sea ruined all hopes of the Commonwealth thriving.

Ghouls and raiders emerged out of the Sea, the former encompassing a population Boston was not familiar with, the latter well-equipped enough such that the city could not handle. Some raiders were ghouls, encouraging bigotry towards them. The raiders migrated from war-torn New York in hopes of finding clean food and water, and they were tough people.

The Minutemen broke the locks of all the armories and began constructing weapons of their own. They had used plenty of robots to make their tours around the Commonwealth, so they were able to assemble an effective Robotics corps. They suppressed the ghouls and gathered them in detention centers - we should remember that these ghouls were former citizens of the Commonwealth, not that this mattered a century later - and decimated the raiders and accepted the rest.

As a result of these events, the Minutemen became the informal government over the Commonwealth, and began calling themselves the Commonwealth Minutemen. Out of love for American ideals, they separated themselves from politics and began implementing secure elections.

This is where things got weird for the Commonwealth Minutemen, as American democracy is representative democracy, which is based off of complicated things like districts. They decided to keep things simple and create electorates based on geography and population - any system would do, likely related to population density.

The consequence of this is that three districts began wielding power above the other districts: the population residing in Fenway Park, Scollay Square and Bunker Hill. Furthermore, they simply lived closest to the State House, so they had the most access to the Commonwealth government. Over time these settlements became corrupt and selfish and proposed more changes that favored themselves over the disparate populations outside of the city, using the ghouls and raiders as bogeymen when they needed to.

Three things forever altered the political landscape of the Commonwealth:

The Institute emerged from the ruins of the Commonwealth Institute of Technology around the time the raiders arrived. Truth be told, the Minutemen never permanently got rid of the raiders - they continually arrived from the Northeast region, and they were always hungry. Though the Minutemen repelled the raiders, the raiders began organizing themselves, forming large camps at the edge of the Glowing Sea. They made frequent raids at Natick, hoping the Minutemen would lose patience and try to attack them in a rash frontal assault.

The Institute was aware of this situation and took advantage of it. Already they were revered as saviors: they had large stores of medical and industrial technology, and had done a great deal of research into food and water production. Furthermore, they were even making headway into eliminating overgrown animals. They offered mobile and portable defenses to settlements, removing some dependence on the Minutemen. Given how much the settlements were sick of the ghouls and raiders, and how the Minutemen could not conclude either, they gladly accepted the Institute's help.

The second development is that a band of Super Mutants made their way into the Commonwealth. They had traveled from Vault 87, located in D.C., for a variety of reasons, the most prominent being boredom. They discovered a cache of FEV samples in an abandoned military base in the Glowing Sea and began creating more Super Mutants.

The Minutemen were located in Fort Independence. The location had two advantages: it was well-stocked in all forms of weaponry and it was close to Boston. Unfortunately, they did not consider the fort's closeness to sea to be a disadvantage. Unbeknownst to them, right below their noses a massive Mirelurk colony was developing. No one knows if the Institute or a businessman from the three Boston settlements tipped them off, but one day the Mirelurks were inflamed and assaulted Fort Independence - and this was the first time anyone in the Commonwealth witnessed the destructive power of a Mirelurk Queen. A great number of the Minutemen's commanding officers were killed in the defense of Fort Independence. Worse, Fort Independence was self-sufficient - there was no alternative location for the Minutemen to gather in.

The domino tiles finally fell. In rapid succession Super Mutants took over Boston's Financial District; the raiders broke through into Weston, Concord and Medford; Diamond City, Goodneighbor and Bunker Hill decried the Minutemen's inconsistency, and defended themselves; and the Institute somehow had its hands over everything. Minutemen began betratying each other and carving out areas in the Commonwealth for provisional governments. Civilization tried to keep itself together for a century, but finally anarchy won.

When the player meets Preston, though he says he is the sole survivor of the Minutemen, he is in reality one of the several groups calling themselves the remnants of the Minutemen, the most significant one being the Gunners. (The Gunners hated the idea of the Minutemen playing politics and went straight towards capitalism for efficiency.) When he joined, the Minutemen were already facing a significant decline in public faith and a lack of focus in mission. The critical events mentioned above happened at least 2 years prior to meeting Preston.

### Institute

The Institute began as a selection of engineers and businessmen. They initially had a democratic process wherein they elected a council of leaders, but that eventually folded into a dictatorship. Since the dictator was a guy everyone knew, and having one guy figure everything out was more efficient, they went along with it.

The Institute was built like a Vault - some of the CIT alumni were high-level operators of Vault Co - so the inhabitants were pretty happy living there. Oddly enough, none of them, even after the first generation died out, were curious about the wasteland. They did send probes to see how the outside situation was, but none of them wanted to actually travel through the wastes.

The biggest problem they faced was genetic diversity. This problem obsessed them constantly, for unexpected reasons as well. Besides wanting to avoid genetic inbreeding, they were also concerned about creating intelligent and, more importantly, _obedient_ children that would forward the research they started. As much as they laughed it off, this attracted them to FEV research.

When the political situation above ground became tenuous, voices made themselves heard to the dictator: We're the descendants of world leaders, how can we forsake the people above any longer? Up until this point the dictator managed to kill the one or two dissenters in secret, but now there were too many people. S/he decided to finally set up an above-ground base in College Square and began making contact with the other settlements in Boston.

If you asked the dictator what they thought of the Minutemen, s/he would honest to God say s/he tried to contact the commanders of the Minutemen for a joint venture. S/he was surprised by how much the Institute enjoyed interacting with the city of Boston, for indecent or honest reasons, all relating to boredom. It just never manifested, however. If it did, they might have prevented the discrimination the Institute encountered: his/her citizens were blamed for _literally_ living under a rock.

The Institute retreated from the public eye for two reasons:

They observed how the Commonwealth treated the Minutemen and concluded that the more the Commonwealth depended on them, the more ungrateful they would be about it. The Institute, believing they were the last bastion of liberal thinking and knowledge, saw themselves as the guardians of civilization, and everyone else were "scavvers". This was even regardless of how much they liked the wastelanders (or, how "adorable" they were to them, like dogs to their masters). All everyone above-ground wanted to do was to reuse the old, corrupt institutions of the past.

Their research into teleportation and FEV was going astoundingly well. The former was a project that had begun even before the Institute was conceived; the latter was aided by the FEV experiments the Super Mutants performed above ground. Teleportation would solve their logistic issues, but the real jewel was the progress in the FEV experiments - they had learned that it was entirely possible to create _people_ using FEV. This would revolutionize the world: you could create smarter, stockier people to repopulate the wasteland and restart civilization again; even better, these people wouldn't engage in stupid wars because they were smarter.

The Institute began receding underground probably a few decades before the start of the game. They enlisted some smart, secretive settlers to join them, and they killed the rest who knew of their location (which turned out to be few, since they were wary from the beginning).

The first synthetic humans were not, as one might expect, met with discrimination, but with openness. After all, these were human beings, and useful too. At some point in time, the Institute did not care who was a synth and who was not; only the mission, to save mankind, was important. Only one person had distinction in the Institute: the man who provided the pre-war DNA needed to create synths, their "Father", who also happened to be the succeeding dictator.

Except some synths did not care one bit for the mission. The Institute did not think people would actually reject their noble cause. When the rebellious synths grew restless regardless of numerous compromises, the zealous synths - who would eventually form the Synth Retention Bureau - slaughtered them, something the humans would never have comprehended doing. For the synths, it was an existential crisis - the humans gave us life, therefore we only exist to serve them.

The remaining synths formed a military within the Institute, as a way of serving their masters and leaving their hands bloodless. Their mission, first and foremost, was to take back escaping synths. These synths were not _only_ people - they were technology, which could be reverse-engineered by malicious actors (and which would be, by the Railroad). Their secondary mission was to bring about the reclaimation of the wasteland, probably by breaking down each settlement and rebuilding them into a unified land governed by wise synths.

When the player visits the Institute, they're in a pretty bad pickle: their efforts to divide and conquer the Commonwealth had been successful _until_ the Brotherhood of Steel came in, indirectly forming an ad hoc military. Furthermore, the Railroad found ways to produce their own synths.

To Father, this all smells like one good opportunity: they could steal back the Railroad's research and use it to destroy the Brotherhood, in one fell swoop.

### Brotherhood of Steel

Now we head to Washington D.C.

Owyn Lyons had the brilliant idea of uniting the various peoples of D.C. into one society, which would productively work upon the technology that was just sitting in the capital. Never was there so much good, even unexplored pre-war technology in one place, given unto so tenacious a people.

The problem was that he made a bad politician. He was not even a good general. What he excelled at was logistics - the expedition from California to the East Coast, negotiating with tribes, securing provisions, appeasing his own men and conscripting only when necessary, this was a feat of genius that no Brotherhood member appreciated. Alas, he had the wrong idea that he also had the brilliance to unite D.C.

When it came down to it, he and his daughter, who was a decent tactician, better soldier, were not politicians. Arthur Maxson, their young charge and the heir to the Brotherhood's legacy, was a better general, decent politician. He had the natural personality of a politician, at least: oversell and don't commit.

Really, all Maxson had to do was appease the people with guns. Reuniting with the Outcasts was obvious, as they understood best how to operate the technology taken recently by the Enclave. Furthermore, the people of D.C. unintentionally looked up to the Brotherhood to protect them as a result of Lyons' efforts, so the best choice was to make a clear and unified military structure, regardless of compromise. Luckily, refocusing the Brotherhood's mission onto technology accomplished both perfectly.

Logically this made sense. Technology protected settlements and produced edible food and drinkable water. Naturally, even if the Brotherhood did not care about civilian life, the research and development into technology would ultimately help D.C. This could be faciliated by promoting a payment scheme where BoS personnel could profit from innovation.

There was only one problem: The BoS was still not a political organization. It acted largely as a tribe wielding the largest cudgel at the time. Sure, people could bring complaints up to the higher officers of the BoS, but there was no mandate that they would be heard. Furthermore, the BoS were often prone to taking whatever they wanted from civilians - they often had the caps to pay for things (they had the most control over the economy, of course), but there would inevitably be some cases where people "conveniently" died.

This was no more apparent than in the construction of the Prydwen. One of the few post-war innovations at its time, Lyons had permitted the Brotherhood Scribes to begin work on the vessel _so long as_ the logistics of the work could be clearly accomplished. This annoyed the Scribes to no end - they were technical people, not coordinators. As a result, the initial planning for the Prydwen took 2 years, most of it figuring out who and where the materials and labor could be taken from. When Lyons died, and complications within the project flared up, the Brotherhood came up with ad hoc solutions to completing the Prydwen, which began to symbolize the legacy of the group. They took the necessary materials for the project using their amassed wealth and, in regions where the law was sketchy, their arms. It was all justified with the convenient excuse of: We protect everyone here, so we deserve better wages, don't you think?

The Brotherhood would free slaves and "hire" them to build the Prydwen. They started conscription of D.C. locals to protect themselves from Super Mutants - not allowing them into the BoS, goodness no, there was still a procedure for admitting members. They also invested into land transport, buying out caravans regularly. All while saying, We're not the government of D.C., we're a private organization.

When the Brotherhood defeated the last Super Mutant army, it was more out of self-defense than any need to protect the region. After all, the Citadel was being bombarded on a regular basis. It was an added bonus that their patrols, as well as finding technology, also ingratiated them to the people of the wasteland.

Maxson does have a genuine concern for the people of the wasteland, but, again, he's only a decent statesman at best. He was too busy to help D.C. set up a sovereign government or construct a government out of a willing Brotherhood body. Worse, he was discouraged from doing so by the Outcasts whose only obsession was acquiring technology. At the Brotherhood's worst, they relived the principle of: 1. Get Technology, 2. ???, 3. Profit!

By the beginning of the game, the adoration for Maxson had begun to wear off, and parties on all sides expected much, much more out of him. The Brotherhood wanted to exercise their ability to project power and retrieve more technology - the Brotherhood's written mission is to be the gatekeepers of technology. Civilians wanted him to actually organize a society.

When Maxson said he gave the crew little directions to begin flight to the Commonwealth, in truth the only reason why he succeeded was because the Brotherhood had broken down fundamentally into a pro-Maxson faction, and everyone else (and these two could be broken down into further factions). The pro-Maxson faction figured out the logistics, while everyone else had to figure out what the new ruling order for D.C. was. This was probably Maxson's intent - he left behind some Outcasts, but he also left behind Brotherhood personnel genuinely interested in constructing a political solution. He was somewhat hoping that when he returned, things would just... kind of resolve itself.

The mission, to destroy synths, was ultimately a ploy to distract the Brotherhood and the people of D.C. He waxed poetic about the dangers of technology, and even convinced himself of the urgency, when in reality the trip was a conscious decision to raise morale and delay the question of D.C's sovereignty. And, given Danse's info, get some pretty serious technology.

If I'm painting a picture of the Brotherhood that looks like incompetence, I want to emphasize they were trained, for decades, to be really good at one thing: murdering people. This specialized knowledge was extremely useful in most scenarios in the wasteland. The Brotherhood soldiers also really liked being good at what they did. To them, it made perfect sense to destroy the Railroad and the Institute. And the Minutemen if they needed to.

### The Railroad

The Railroad is at once a new and old player in Commonwealth politics.

The Railroad was simply a solution to the ghouls and raiders. Hell, they might have even called themselves Minutemen at one point in time. If they did, they were a sympathetic factions to the migrants. They functioned much like the NCR Rangers, in that they were initially constructed by volunteers. Eventually they consolidated around one mission: to facilitate the citizenship of abnormal people. Of course, they were not known to the Minutemen rank-and-file.

The concept of "borders" is a little loose without fortifications of any kind. The Railroad often infiltrated raider groups, uncovered the various factions, and then reported back to their superiors which among them were suitable for society and which should be destroyed. This helped the Commonwealth's overall aims in terms of population and military.

Sometimes their jobs involved finding places to locate ghouls. In the beginning they picked out subway stations. This was not funny to the ghouls.

The Railroad began disassociating itself from the Minutemen once anti-ghoul politics began playing out - many of its own recruits were ghouls. The marriage formally ended when Diamond City gathered enough votes to end the Railroad. Since they knew where all the secret places were, they just simpled relocated into the subways they once offered to ghouls. Irony is a bitch.

It just never made sense how the people of the Commonwealth were hoarding their relatively Rad-free land and water, and how most of that land wasn't even _occupied_. The Railroad never ended operations, though they had to continue without official funding. As it turns out, the people of Boston were kind enough to donate a few caps now and then to the Railroad cause. A bigger benefice came from Bunker Hill, whose caravans often employed cheap labor.

The Railroad experienced dramatic growth when they made a lucky find.

A Railroad operative was approached by an individual looking for rehabilitation - a plot of land in the boonies worked great for them. S/he asked the individual the usual set of questions: where did you come from and what was your previous trade? To his/her surprise, they answered: I was created in the Institute, and I had worked as a scientist.

Synths up until that point had escaped from the Institute, but none of them had ever heard of the Railroad. Not only did the Railroad make contact with a synth smart enough and friendly enough to locate them, but they also found someone who was technically proficient in the construction of _himself_. They were at once astounded by the Institute's ability to create humans and that they possessed that ability for themselves.

Imagine a world where one could create better humans, or augment humans to be better, faster, stronger. This was bigger picture than supplying labor to caravan traders. Railroad leaders debated endlessly on the ethics of it all, probably more than the Institute did in its lifetime.

Unfortunately, the synth did not want to participate in any of these activities... unless there was a price attached. Located in Salem, Railroad scientists would often consult the synth on various Institute technology for caps. Eventually, as they were able to incorporate synths into the organization, they no longer needed the synth.

Bunker Hill, sensing the economic opportunity, increased their investment in the Railroad. They were finally able to pay their operatives wages. Furthermore, they came upon a uniting ideal for the future of synths: that, no different than ghouls, they should be accepted by the Commonwealth populace. (Luckily for synths, they looked human.) To this end, they sold synths (with consent) to the settlements scattered across the Commonwealth looking for specialized talent; the leaders of the settlements would keep the transfer secret, setting up housing and back stories for the synths; the synth would have some starting savings; and the Railroad pocketed a percentage of the sale. Synth business was good business.

The radical leadership of the Railroad slowly grew a dedicated military arm composed of synths and researched the production of synths. To them, synths were the future of mankind - the synths were going to take over one day, so why not make the date sooner rather than later? They prepared plans to take over the settlements by force and establish a synth upper class over the Commonwealth.

A distinction should be made between the Institute and the Railroad's plans. The Institute's plans were created by synths who believed fundamentally in the servant-master role to humans. Synths are servants - they serve through their wisdom and strength. Humanity's future is its own. The Railroad believed synths were fundamentally human, and it was obvious these humans were better than the regular, womb-created humans; naturally, they would rule the world one day, over the normals. One could see why the Brotherhood, trigger-happy as they are, would say, My God, these people are nuts.

These beliefs were only held by the radical faction, however. Most Railroad operatives rested in the murky grey of the synth question.

By the beginning of the game, the Railroad are on their way to a significant development: they had finally reverse-engineered the manufacturing process of synths and were nearly completing plans to do their own creating, based on their circumstances. Though Railroad leadership overall has mixed feelings about the use of this technology, the implications were clear: with a synth army, the Commonwealth can be stabilized and the Railroad could recreate the terms for social living. After that, the knives would be drawn out between the Railroad factions.

## Explanations

The biggest problem with Fallout 4's writing is that it isn't coherent. The War of the Commonwealth competes with the issue of finding your son, and as far as I can tell both events don't coincide thematically. Furthermore, you don't get a good idea of the past/present/future of many characters - as in, where does the Railroad get so many recruits? Why was Maxson able to ditch his old gig in D.C.? Why did people pass on a volunteer fighting force in the form of the Minutemen, when these things would naturally occur? My guess is that, as in all projects, the team ran out of time and money. Most of the time and money went on the _feel_ of the game - such that the game feels really, really good to play and has immersion - rather than the details of the world itself. This is why people accuse Fallout of becoming an action series - which isn't an incorrect statement, though at the end of the day, if as a product manager one had to spend time and energy on the gameplay versus the story details, one would likely prioritize the former. (Though it is an entirely valid argument to say the roleplaying experience, via the story, is a significant part of the gameplay.)

As an individual I look at scenarios in a certain way, and for Fallout 4 I rewrote the factions to coincide with my perspective on state sovereignty; through state sovereignty, you have the theme of individual sovereignty, the roleplayed character's ability to shape their own future. I don't know if this was intended by the writing, but the most apparent threat to the Commonwealth's safety is violence, more than radiation (as in Fallout 3). This is cemented by the ability to cook clean food and generate clean water, and that there are constant attacks on settlements. Therefore, a reason needs to explain why there is no centralized group that neutralizes and deters violence, because this would be immensely useful for all parties involved. Thus my answer resorted to the problem of state sovereignty: the overwhelming urge for the individual to control their own destiny, as well as the destinies of others. Violent factionalism arose in the Commonwealth because no one could compromise on their own idea of destiny; this was exacerbated by the discovery of a revolutionary technology.

### The Minutemen, Explained

The Commonwealth Minutemen are the most logical solution to the problem of sovereignty because almost every state in history has went that route: an impartial military serving statesmen who implement solutions concerning the state. The military is focused on defending the borders and anticipating and preventing threats, while the statesmen figure out how to get various groups with various personalities to work together.

If this all sounds tenuous, it is. In a sophisticated society, the advantages of accepting social order outweigh the disadvantages. In a starting society, there will be _lots_ of false starts and legally grey areas. This encourages people to say, Screw this, let's just start over again. The perceived self-control of one's own destiny is considered better than the marginal loss to food and water production.

The need for the Minutemen are simple and their demise is just as simple. Preston Garvey is by no means a good politician or general; he has no creativity to speak of but displays great courage and self-initiative. If the Minutemen were all like him, then they would be admired for being the first to fight. In terms of building a complex society, they would be ineffectual. The representatives elected by settlements, too, were ineffectual, or disinterested in building an organized society.

Luckily for the Minutemen, courage is always in constant demand.

### The Institute, Explained

The Institute in Fallout 4 does not satisfy the questions of why and how. They're seen as constantly scheming, though what they are precisely scheming is not clear. The write-up intends to answer both questions, as well as who.

The only option that seemed available to me was to split up who had what opinion. The director of the Institute, who really owns more power than he realizes, probably is not very good at politics, nor has the interest in it. It doesn't make sense that he would seek a political solution for the Commonwealth - he really does not have any plans for the Commonwealth other than "make technology; synths are good." He would want to focus more on the Institute's research and the egos of the intellectuals surrounding him. Having the synths, who do all the fighting, become the warring faction makes the most sense. No matter how strong synths are, they're always going to lose on a tactical level if they're commanded by scientists.

The worst part of the Institute as depicted in Fallout 4 is that they have no past or future. What conflicts did they have to struggle through in the past? Where do they want to go in the future? The write-up makes clear that their biggest flaw is a complete indifference to their fellow man. They _want_ to participate in humanity's future, but they're constantly trying to fit a scientific solution in when a pragmatic solution would do just fine. In reality, the world around them does not need cutting-edge technology; they're unwilling to accept this, as this would mean they were lower-class citizens to politicians or businessmen. They too have their own vision for the future, which is a utopia of thought. Luckily for them, they discovered technology that could feasibly get them there.

As idealistic as they are humanistically, they're incredibly practical when it comes to technology itself. When the player visits the Institute for the first time, the argument of "synths as technology" should hit them at full force. It makes absolute sense for the Institute to be the sole handlers of this technology, as they know how to control it and destroy it when necessary. Furthermore, this technology is even more dangerous in the hands of other people. This would be the basis for the reasoning for the player to side with them.

### Brotherhood of Steel, Explained

The biggest flaw in the writing of the Brotherhood is the reason why they flew to the Commonwealth. They assembled all this technology just to lose men and resources on some synths who are soldiers and spies... which every human being is.

I fixed this by giving Maxson a practical reason - politics at home - and a philosophical reason, that being the existential threat of the synths themselves. The idea of a superior human being, used as an oppressor, offends Maxson, and he is aware that one day the Institute will lose control over the synths. The synths aren't an immediate threat to him, but when organized, like the Super Mutants once were, they can destroy whatever fragile peace the wasteland may have.

### The Railroad, Explained

The Railroad are in the same boat as the Institute - no why and how. It needed to be demonstrated "why" such a large group of people would assemble and invest so much energy in a cause, and "how" they acquired skills/equipment. I understand the Railroad is an analogy to the Underground Railroad, but the Railroad has quite a bit of firearms and people who use them - and enough know-how to blow up the Prydwen, of all things.

The real Underground Railroad, from my understanding, was not organized - trails were constructed out of ad hoc solutions; the Railroad of Fallout 4 would have needed funding and recruitment. The supplies could have came in from Bunker Hill, so long as they profitted from the Railroad's deeds; the recruitment would have naturally come from the synths, who would want their own kind to be free. The synths also being programmed with skills, it made sense that they would be the preferred recruit over the conspicuous wastelander.

It also made sense to me to split the Railroad into factions. Again, unlike the actual Underground Railroad, synths fit into an uneasy definition of humanity - even if every member fundamentally agreed on the freedom of synths, they may disagree on where synths belong with human beings. I think a roleplayer would actually find exploring the spectrum fascinating, and the Railroad would be the best faction to explore the thought.

## Evolution of the game

The main quest line revolves around what I call the "Synth Question" - that is, what are synths in relation to humanity? In answering this question, one raises questions about the destiny of society.

The Kellogg we see in the game would not be the Kellogg who stole Shaun. The Institute by that time had completely modified Kellogg's brain to the extent that he might as well be a synthetic lifeform; memories exist within that shell, if only to keep it temporally anchored. This would be the first real encounter that the player would have with synths. In fact, there could even be an option to revive Kellogg and have him be a companion. That would really spice things up for roleplayers.

We can add dialogue options for Virgil when he talks about his becoming a Super Mutant. Something like, "We marveled at how the FEV was able to take all of the human flaws, even intelligence, and erase them as if they never existed... But when I finally used the FEV on myself, I regretted instantly the loss of my humanity. I couldn't even explain it."

The first Courser the player meets can have a bit more personality. He might even negotiate with the player: "My boss is going to kill me if I lose a limb over one lousy synth. Tell you what: I'll help you out, but you have to trust me. I can't get you a Courser chip... but I can get you the same tech. You can't tell anyone about this, of course. I'll drop it off tomorrow in, say... this cabinet. Why would I help you? I'd call this a quid quo pro - I give you this one thing, and we all get to keep our jobs and our ammo and our lives. Simpler than me just killing you. And it's not like I care if you get into the Institute - the Commonwealth will soon see enough of it, anyhow."

To make things interesting, what if a Brotherhood scout accompanied you when you meet the Courser? The Brotherhood has a mutual interest in getting a Courser's corpse, so they offer to send a scout to help you find the Courser. In the above scenario, the scout reacts: "You just saw what he did to a whole troop! That thing's not human - and even then, why should you trust the words of a robot?" This could cause an ethical dilemna.

This would also allow the player to meet all 4 factions in a playthrough of the first act of the game, so they can decide on who they agree with.

Meeting the Railroad, to get to Tinker Tom, could be interesting. The first thing you could see is a synth being created in a makeshift "bathtub"; however, Desdemona remarks that, without the proper equipment, the synth has failing organs and an underdeveloped intelligence. She comments on canceling the experiment (in reality, if one joins the Railroad, she resumes the experiment).

When the player finally enters the Institute, they are assigned to meet the leader of the SRB. Unlike the scientists in the game, the leader, who is a synth, actually gives all of their attention to the player and attempts to make the player feel comfortable (again, the master-servant relationship). The leader emphasizes that everything they do is for the Commonwealth; they discipline synths who do not obey; Shaun is not accountable for the deaths of innocent people.

In _reality_, after the Battle of Bunker Hill, Shaun marvels at finally seeing a synth-operated settlement and proclaims that this is the future, one ruled by superior intelligence. You can see advanced equipment being installed in Bunker Hill. The settlers are treated as slaves, though they are not called so; their only purpose under synth rule is to use the caravan routes to spread Institute influence. Shaun shows that he absolutely knew about the synths' plans and even encouraged them. This is the point where the player, failing to convince their son of the violence he is causing, can defect to another faction.

The plot of the game converges around the Beryllium Agitator, a piece of technology that produces an enormous amount of energy. If the Institute or the Railroad get their hands on it, they meet all their energy concerns for producing synths and weapons. If the Brotherhood gets it, then they can rebuild Liberty Prime, the ultimate robot. The Minutemen may want to snatch the Agitator from the hands of all of these factions, so none of them can abuse its potential; Sturges may in fact experiment with it to provide power for all of Boston, lighting up the city at the end of the game in a dramatic gesture.

Factions can broker peace with each other. The Minutemen are apoltical and are short on numbers in the beginning of the game, so they can make peace with the other three factions by serving them. (Otherwise, the Minutemen would have to reunite the Commonwealth settlements to gain any foothold.) The Brotherhood can, surprisingly, make peace with the Institute, on the condition that the Institute limits the production of synths and biological mods. The Institute can also make peace with the Railroad - by eliminating the extreme heads of both factions (Shaun and Desdemona), the moderate wings can unite for the sake of synth-kind. It is impossible for the Brotherhood and the Railroad to make peace, as they are diametrically opposed on the Synth Question.

## Wrapping things up and the future of the series

There are a number of small, fun things I would like:

-   There would be no 1st or 2nd Generation Synths in the Institute; the player would only see Coursers, robots and maybe even synthetic dogs.

-   The player character would occasionally see "megabrahmin" that the Institute accidentally unleashed on the wasteland.

-   A group of intelligent super mutants (probably from a vault) communicate with the Railroad.

-   The Minutemen recruit raiders to their cause.

-   The Brotherhood use the Institute's mods on soldiers (seeing Star Paladin Cross was a cyborg herself).

Everything essential, however, has been covered. If the write-up covered up one critical flaw of the original game, the flaw would be that synths are essentially just robots with human flesh; they're not any smarter than robots nor, and this is the most important trait, are they any more creative. It's surprising the original game writers didn't focus on this particular aspect of the synths, since it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschinenmensch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pretty</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered</a> in popular fiction, and since Fallout is a pretty damn nerdy world (where fans love to get into the narrow of reality and fantasy) it would have been a great place to address themes of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Alas, the game fails this potential.

If I'd love the series to go anywhere, I'd like to see the opposite of what happened on the West Coast happen on the East Coast: where most territory by the Pacific is consolidated under the New California Republic, I'd like the East Coast to remain fragmented among feudal states, meaning the Institute and the Minutemen do reconcile, the Railroad genuflects, and they oust the Brotherhood, leading to a Northeast rivalry. That would leave for the series a rather rich future.
