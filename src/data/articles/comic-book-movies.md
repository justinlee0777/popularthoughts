Yes, I'm returning back to Martin Scorsese's famous <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/irishman-week-martin-scorsese-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> on comic book movies, and I'm agreeing with him, but with a different type of analysis.

I think the whole concept of a "superhero" is incompatible with art, the more I think about it. A "superhero" as an entity is something distinct from the "action hero", a distinction that somehow makes a world of difference, as well as a difference between a "hero" and an "action hero".

Well, while we're being pedantic about it, let's dive deeper into what are examples of each, and I will try to give definitions, but the definitions will likely be inadequate for some reasons.

A good old "hero" is Odysseus or Orpheus or Dante in the "Divine Comedy". Or George Bailey. A hero is a person who is going through a fundamental journey that challenges everything he is: his personality, his way of thinking, the physique and mental preparedness he is at that moment, his _identity_, in short. A hero must undergo _katabasis_, a Greek word roughly meaning a descent. A hero descends so that they may ultimately come back up more enlightened, having seen the chaos of the world and how it can be useful for humanity (which includes him/herself).

An "action hero" is Sarah Conner, Ellen Ripley, Max Rockatansky, Rocky Balboa. An action hero is someone that exists primarily in a visual sense; iconography is directly linked to the influence of an action hero. There are really no action heroes in literature for that reason - you can list any number of science fiction and fantasy characters, but literature is memorable due to dialogue, psychological depth, scenario, especially for science fiction and fantasy.

We remember Ripley because we remember her confronting the alien; we remember Max because he fought in the Thunderdome; we remember Rocky because we're with him as he fought Apollo. What separates an action hero and a hero is empathy. You _may_ empathize Odysseus; what's more important is that you respect him, for his intellect and the pains he goes through. You _must_ empathize with an action hero, or they'll pass from your brain. Empathy is partly intellectual, but so much of it is visceral, and it's the audio-visual nature of film that allows us to connect a specific struggle to an "action hero".

What a "superhero" is is very conflicted. They may not even be a "hero", given the definition above, especially when a superhero is expected to _always_ be fighting, thereby always undergoing change. This makes no logical sense after a while, because we expect the human intellect to be at least somewhat stable.

A superhero is most certainly an "action hero", but _only_ in the iconographic sense. A superhero must look distinguishing. Even the plain-clothed X-Men are distinguished by certain poses, certain powers - we associate their superpowers with the superhero's identity.

This is one part of the problem, and it's a big one. A character's super strength most certainly overshadows who the person is. The character can certainly take memorable actions and be involved in memorable things, but that is almost remembered apart from their distinguishing superpower. If it is the case that the latter is the _only_ important factor, then let's see if we can remove the superhero's superpower and whether people still call them a superhero.

A superhero is someone who is above a regular person and is capable of doing inhuman things. In the above, a hero and an action hero _must be_ human; _katabasis_ is human and we must empathize with a human being. Even Heracles, a hero capable of quite outlandish feats, is merely _exceptionally_ strong, and we're pretty sure his actions were metaphorial in nature rather than in reality. A superhero is someone who by necessity acts in reality; they are super, they are above reality.

The issues with iconography and the hero's relationship with reality are probably some of the reasons why Scorsese said a superhero movie is fundamentally an amusement park ride. We are impressed by a superhero because of their exterior qualities; we are amazed by their power and we think they look cool.

Without these qualities, a superhero is pretty much just an action hero, and I think that's how the most memorable "superhero" movies operate. "Shazam!" and the second Sam Raimi "Spider-Man" are excellent examples of superhero movies, but that's precisely because the directors took pains to make the heroes look human, to ensure that their actions are symbolic in nature only and not in reality.

Even then, the question still remains: could you detach the Shazam and Spiderman IPs from those projects, and the projects would still work from a storytelling perspective? If Billy Batson, instead of turning into Shazam, turned into a funny-looking man in a puffy suit, and if Peter Parker was merely an exceptional man, and Doctor Octopus not an octopus, would anything be lost from the movies? The answer is no and yes. No, in the sense that you would still have empathy with the character. Yes, in that the characters lose the pre-established mythos surrounding that character, even when they are seen anew. That is, of course, why comic book writers, even creative content creators everywhere, prefer to use an existing IP over anything new - the baggage saves you from needing to embellish the hero's heroics on the first try.

This really stops being a matter of, "Can comic book movies have artistry in them?" It's really a matter of "Can comic book movies be exemplars of art i.e. precise, intellectual, the _definition_ of beauty rather than a re-confirmation of it?" They simply cannot be because the "superhero" aspect is always unnecessary - really, _always_. As a thought exercise, think of a story that absolutely requires a character to be a _super_-hero; I've tried it, you can remove the superhero every time.

Even thinking on some of the things Alan Moore has attempted in his career, especially in "Watchmen", at the core of them he is playing around with the concept of power and responsibility and how they contrast with the concept of the individual. To be honest, such a theme is better served, at least from a philosophical standpoint, from a more realistic premise. Funnily enough, Damon Lindelof's "Watchmen", which specifically focused on non-superpowered costumed vigilantes, actually did a lot of interesting things with this theme by looking at it through the lens of white supremacy and crime.

And let's be clear that this is a conclusion on a technical matter only; I'm not arguing that comic book movies should not be made or they don't have value - people pay billions to make and watch them, of course they have value - I'm merely arguing for the technical aspect of storytelling, what it is and what it can be, much in the same way we can discuss what constitutes a master-class meal. I highly doubt a professional chef could make a delicious, nutritious meal out of McDonald's fries, though I myself like. In that sense, a Marvel movie can be delicious, it can most certainly inspire, it can most certainly be innovative, but, as intelligence demands exactness, it cannot be a particularly intelligent, and therefore fulfilling, film.
