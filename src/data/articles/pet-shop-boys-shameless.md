I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### The Pet Shop Boys' Shameless

Let's just get all the pop songs out of the way, shall we.

This is my favorite song of 2023. Released in 1993. Step up your game, 2023.

Actually I feel a lot of guilt concerning the Pet Shop Boys and the music surrounding their 1993 album, "Very", chiefly around the fact that the aforementioned album may be my favorite album of that year. This is not trivial. 1993 was a great year. The Wu-Tang's debut and The Breeders' "Last Splash" came out this year. I feel pretty bad, honestly, snatching that victory from Deals' hands. But "Very" is, well, very, very good, but it's good in a different way than "Shameless" is, so let's set that aside for now.

Though it is worth mentioning that putting Neil Tennant's yawn of a voice on a dance track, in itself, is poignant. His silky voice juxtaposed to the pummeling beats of "Very" (see: "Yesterday When I Was Mad") shows very much how resilient it is, which is the theme of that album.

And that's what "Shameless" is: the Boys at their most caustic and cynical and, in their characteristic manner, completely at ease. Hatred is unseemly in most, and comes out awkwardly and pubescently. The Boys don't hate; in their charming way they love, though with the occasional side-long glance.

Tennant's primitive beat, "umm-ah-ah-umm-ah-ah-umm-umm", begins the track, as if he alone were enough to depict a purgatory of very lazy, very stupid people. Unfortunately for me, I can't find out who is sampled for the vocal bits: that posh voice beginning the track with "Hello", following with an ecstatic "Darling!" Of the Boys' discrography, this is the one I've heard that is sculptured by, well, noise, layering onto a chaotic intro that launches into the rush.

One of the funny things about Tennant's lyrics is that they're sometimes _bad_, and yet they somehow make their U-turn around to being _good_. Thus the opening: "I know what you think, / it's clear as mud in your eyes." What does that mean, Neil?? But he's such an accomplished singer that the delivery sells it: he says the metaphor so lazily such that you, the listener, are always putting more energy into thinking about it than he is. And that is, indeed, the intentional craft, his mocking the very idea of being clever and, therefore, precious.

Succeeding is this very funny line: "You don't know nothing; / you're not hot enough to matter" (which is followed later by, "Don't call me pathetic, / I'm hotter than you'll ever guess!"). Which has echoes of "Opportunities": "I've got the brains, you've got the looks, / let's make lots of money." But this reveals why I like "Shameless" so much more. "Opportunities", through that drum kick, stutters, while "Shameless", following the lines, exultantly enters it chorus, frothing into a rave: "We're shameless! / We will do anything / to get our fifteen minutes of fame! / We have no integrity, / we're ready to crawl / to obtain celebrity." "Opportunities", like a lot of the Boys' oeuvre, is wonderful psychological matter, but "Shameless" embraces the stupidity of its inhabitants, perhaps foreshadowed by Tennant's earlier "umm-ah-ah-umm".

I can't say I understand what the Boys intended with this song, but I love both of the song's codes: being that of a condemnation of such naked ambition, and of indulging in our being attention whores, to a certain extent. There's the very human verse: "Tell me you love me, / admit it, you're really impressed." Human beings are full of contradiction, and can contain self-loathing and delusions of grandeur at once. So, whenever I listen to this song, I embrace both the cynical and the ecstatic interpretations. I think this is somewhat correct, as "Very" itself is about contradiction, of ignoring doubt, about oneself, about other people, while still nurturing it. Appropriately, the song ends with the Pachelbel's Canon theme as its A-side, "Go West", does, as if the Boys thought it were very funny to end such a shameless song with the "wedding song". (On the topic of shamelessness, it's worthwhile to note that Liverpool Echo thought "Go West" was the "funniest thing they've done for ages". Tennant's crooning over the Village People is at once funny and awe-inspiring.) Certainly a "have your cake and eat it too" song, lyrically, aesthetically, which reminds one of [Divine literally eating dog shit from the street and smiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpFiGfvT0w8).

For this reason, I somewhat wish they found space to put "Shameless" into "Very". For the laconic Boys, "Very" is a mad rush, towards love, towards ecstasy, towards freedom, and "Shameless" epitomizes that. Of course, it doesn't work thematically with the album's overall positive message. It's a curiosity for sure, a bridge between the moody "Behavior" and joyous "Very", carrying with it a nagging doubt that its narcissism isn't without its flaws; and so we make a U-turn from this thoroughly silly song to being so intelligently crafted.
