If I'm watching "Trainspotting" again, I may stop after the 1-hour mark.

Or some time after the famous bedroom scene. The film begins with Iggy Pop's "Lust for Life", jet-fueled punk rock that must be better than any drug - I'm speculating - Henton, the protagonist of the movie, wheeling through life as if on a tricycle as he barrels through his life up to that point while tripping out on heroin in a breathless, relentless monologue on how life absolutely has no meaning and the only reason why smack is good is because it adds no meaning to life and is honest for it. _Tour de force_ is not an adequate phrase to describe the film's assault.

Even after this scene the film doesn't slow down. Renton fishes for pills in a shit-covered toilet, hangs out with his friends shooting dogs, passes speed to a job seeker, observes a bar fight, looks for sex. Where we believe Renton's beginning monologue is spoken only by a thoroughly cynical shithead, we see the world around his life is truly, genuinely shitty and loathsome, where people are constantly trying to find kicks in a meaningless world.

What impresses me with the film is its total commitment to Renton's nihilistic argument. Most writers would be shy of saying life has no meaning - in fact, it does not speak well for their trade if that were the case. The film embraces this and extends the argument to every facet of life, ending ultimately, neatly I should say, with Renton ranting about how shitty it is to be Scottish and how the Scottish are the shit of the earth. And I want to say that the argument itself is worthwhile - there is use in exploring the argument, but we may reject the argument if we so desire.

The second act of the film focuses on the lows that follow the high, going very, very low indeed, ending with the famous bedroom scene. This too is extremely creative.

I think the third act is essentially Renton trying to move on with his life and ridding himself of his old kicks, which... on paper and in practice is not as good as the first two acts. In fact, it becomes nearly a character drama with people who were established as being not necessarily real.

Renton's final act, where he betrays his asshole friends (justifiable) and promises to truly live a normal life now, is almost a betrayal to us, the audience, who can't really come to understand why he wants to make that change; it would have made more sense that, not wanting to live indecently anymore, he would have nothing to turn to, only a duffel bag that alone has no meaning to him.

I'm getting really fascinated with a kind of "degenerate" genre of storytelling. It's the same genre that "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" belongs to, as well as "The Wolf of Wall Street", which the third act of "Trainspotting" resembles. It's the same genre "Bouvard and Pecuchet" and "Candide" belong to, if you think about it. The idea of pulling a protagonist through all of humanity's depravity, gritted teeth or not, is intellectually fascinating, though morally we balk at it. The stories must be comedic, because we're taking a piss at humanity's sense of decency. "The Wolf of Wall Street" to me is the perfect evolution of "Trainspotting": unlike Renton, Belfort's self-destruction is justified by his wealth, enabling him to go onward to worse and worse acts, and when he self-destructs, he does so spectacularly and magnificently. This coming from a Catholic film-maker.

But even Scorsese seems to back out from "The Wolf of Wall Street" a little; you see him flinching when Belfort is finally caught, almost sympathizing with his arrest, and subsequent re-invention as a motivational speaker. _Almost_. I think the purest comedowns have come from the French, especially in "Candide", which is happy in its massacres, rapes, mutilations.

I did not like "Trainspotting" indulging the audience a little in giving Renton a bit of hope. The truth is, we're not 50/50 in Renton's re-invention; though he has relapsed in the past, we're given ample evidence, through the betrayal, through his renewed philosophy, that he might actually change. I obviously don't want to see his character suffer, but from a perspective outside of the film, seeing the film as art and looking at it as a logical construct, the film hadn't really tackled Renton's initial hedonistic worldview, it only tried to subvert it by mentioning that the worldview has downsides. As opposed to what, his dystopian vision of a life of mediocrity that only contains downsides?

That being said, as I run the film in my mind again, this critique does not blunt the film's power. Those first two acts alone bore the film into memory, and they can be easily dissected from the last third of the film. Visually, it's striking today, twenty years later. It still holds your breath. The effortless ranting could even teach a student of prose how to write engrossing passages.

But for a film that apparently caused so much controversy when it came out, there's not much left over after the rush.

### Other thoughts

If we're speaking of stories on addiction, the exemplar is still Malcolm Lowry's "Under The Volcano". I think William Gass said it was one of the few "true" tragedies of the English language; I'll add that, where many tragedies are the results of unfortunate circumstances, "Under the Volcano" is a true tragedy of character. There are many similarities between Renton and the Consul, and there are stylistic similarities between the film and the novel, but the novel is, for one, total, intellectually and artistically, and for two, it outdoes "Trainspotting" and becomes transcendental, especially in its ending.

The connection to "Under the Volcano" occurred to me when I woke up and observed the spring morning, possibly because I was dreaming of Renton's drug-fuelled escapades the night before. As I looked outside I became sad, because "Under the Volcano" is a very sad, not bleak, novel indeed.
