In his acceptance speech for "J R", William Gaddis said: "I feel like part of the vanishing breed that thinks a writer should be read and not heard, let alone seen. I think this is because there seems so often today to be a tendency to put the person in the place of his or her work, to turn the creative artist into a performing one, to find what a writer says about writing somehow more valid, or more real, than the writing itself." (Pilfered from the <a href="http://williamgaddis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Gaddis website itself</a>.)

"Confessional" is a dumb word. Whether it's applied to men or, more likely, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/09/why-are-only-women-described-as-confessional-singer-songwriters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">women</a>, it aims to render the artist useless in the face of criticism, positive or negative.

Art encompasses many meanings, but, removing art from any connotation of greatness, the most basic definition, if we go by Merriam-Webster, is a "skill acquired by experience, study, or observation". A skill produces something - whether it's a performance or a physical artifact. Regardless, it's something someone _intentionally_ does and _consciously_ intends. (If you're trying to achieve something non-trivial, then _by experience_ you would know the thing you are trying to achieve is non-trivial and you also understand the steps to non-trivially achieve that goal.) When you neither intentionally construct nor consciously intend something, you can maybe fool someone dumber than me, but I know you half-assed it. In fact, most people will know whether you half-assed it. (Sometimes people like the half-assing though.)

So to call something "confessional", as in, "informed by the artist's own life", is stripping away any power that art has over people. The truth is, artists make things up. They have to. They're not making up this or that event, but their work is like a sequence: you end up moving things around the sequence, change how one idea transitions to the next, and sometimes you do indeed make up minor details. Otherwise, the sequence fails to produce the desired result, which is a certain emotion or idea.

Most "confessional" music is a mix-up of the artist's real life, their fantasies, and their technical skill at telling a flowing, continous story. I mean, did "Blackout" depict David Bowie's life? What about Tribe's "Verses from the Abstract"? Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin'"? Ok, so can we now see that saying Joni Mitchell's "California" as "confessional" is really dumb? You're making a judgment about the artist and constructing a narrative around the singer, when you should be looking at the songs itself. In short: you need a life.

Conversely, it's stupid to _praise_ music for being "confessional". Part of this article was inspired by comparing Waxahatchee's "Out in the Storm" to last year's critical darling, Phoebe Bridgers "Punisher". I know it's mean to say, but "Punisher" is eye-rollingly painful. The composition, on second listen, captures the emotional state Bridgers is trying to convey, but her lyrics are just duds, all of them heavy-handed. The chorus of "Garden Song" has entered into my memory ("I don't know when you got taller / There must be something in the water"); everything else is her struggling to get to the emotional core of her songs, noting details that have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the song except they are endearing. In "Kyoto" she is noting irrelevant details in her trip to Japan until she arrives to a phone call from an immoderate friend, and in "Punisher" she's just stumbling through some catharsis. I usually like music that tends towards the dream-pop side, but the Reid brothers knew well the divide between reality and fantasy, and they picked a lane. Not saying Bridgers isn't a talented person, but the material is genuinely insufferable, like a Post Malone or Justin Bieber song. I can't be certain why "Punisher" was so beloved - my guess is that people sympathized with the "confessional" material, read: they thought the honesty was nice, and the honesty was dressed up with a good compositional mind.

### Out in the Storm

This is not to detract from "Out in the Storm", which is the real album under discussion; it's probably my favorite "indie" album of the 2010s, whatever that means. Well...let's break down what "indie" means first, to me - if the instrumentation is clear, the narrator is reliable, and the lyrics convey a clear narrative, then let's just call that "indie". Let's just stick with that for the context of this article. So a Destroyer album or Fiona Apple's last two albums would _not_ count (unreliable narrator, and the instrumentation conveys a complex not-even-mood), but Mitski's "Be the Cowboy" and Grouper's "Ruins" _would_ (very clear what they're singing about, and for the latter it's clear what she's intending to do, though the recording quality is muddled). By the way, those last two albums are _excellent_ and I encourage a listen.

The greatness of "Out in the Storm" comes from the lyrics. One of the pinnacles come early in "Silver", as the narrator breathlessly executes this verse about an incident with a lover:

"Telling classic stories, smothered underneath formality;<br/>
I'll portray the old shag carpet, you can walk all over me."

You feel the anger, but not only that, you feel the anger simmer. On further analysis, it's a dense two-liner - the first three words (three!) convey the physical situation that you see in your head; the next three conveys to you how it felt to be in that situation, as a third-person bystander; then the next six you suddenly become the narrator as she makes a joke, and the last words are used to describe what can be seen alternately as rage and defeat. It's easy not to be impressed after making the analysis, but if you zoom backwards a bit and consider the precision, the rhythm, the imagery of those 18 words, you realize Waxahatchee (in real life, Katie Crutchfield) had to condense whatever material she had and give it its proper form to pull off the execution of those lines. Together, they form one of my favorite verses ever in the last 10 years.

"Brass Beam":

"I took a pill, I went to sleep for the first time in weeks;<br/>
you kept me up, with all your manic energy -<br/>
I had to go and put it out just like a cigarette.<br/>
I'll never be a girl you'd like or trust or you'd respect.<br/>

When I think about it, I want to punch the wall;<br/>
now I remember everything, I wonder if I'll always feel small."

Another of my favorites. These form the first lines of "Brass Beam" - the first four words introduce you to the scenario in a vivid way, using clear imagery; she then follows up with the meaning behind the scenario, as well as the emotional state of the narrator. Then comes in the narrator's lover, entering the privacy of the first line, introduced as another, uncontrolled character, almost an antagonist. The narrator must - _must_ - react to this external presence. _External_ is a word that must be analyzed - you know this presense is external because it has nothing to do with the original scenario, her trying to sleep. In this subtle way, you understand there is a distance between the narrator and this character - almost as if she were a Kafka character - and in this way you understand immediately the relationship she has with her lover.

Because you understand the implicit meaning of the previous three lines, the narrator perfectly earns the next line: "I'll never be a girl you'd like or trust or you'd respect". It doesn't get more powerful than that; special attention should be paid to the "you'd" ("you would"), implying a state of eternity - this is not something she feels at the moment, this is something she will feel forever. It's worth noting that this is not just an emotional expression - it is a logical, intellectual clarification of her situation. She alternates between expressing her frustration in a physical way and a personal, mental way: "I'll never be a girl you'd like or trust or you'd respect" - she is detaching herself from the situation, observing herself as any woman, and coming to the conclusion that she won't earn respect; "When I think about it, I want to punch the wall" - the thought, the rational and emotional thought, culminates into violence, violence to an external presence, violence to herself; "now I remember everything, I wonder if I'll always feel small" - the narrator has switched the timeline into the future, the "now", and conflates her sadness with the physical feeling of being "small". All phrases or expressions that any person would make, but the juxtaposition of them, as well as their relationship to the idea - the story, the theme of frustration and self-deprecation - is what makes the verses so beautiful.

"A Little More":

"We pretend to be kind, I hold everything back -<br/>
You politely point out, all of the goodness this world lacks...<br/>
You draw x's on our backs."

What strikes me the most is that Waxahatchee's lyrics describe the moral and intellectual feelings the narrator has as she passes from situation to situation. In most cases, even in my favorite albums, the narrator focuses on the complexity of the emotional situation only (pick any, really: "Astral Weeks", "Funhouse", "Idler Wheel..."). She pulls it off effortlessly. When an aritst typically discusses their ego or personal matters, they come off as either 1) pedantic or 2) cloying (Morrissey and Kanye West, respectively). In these songs Crutchfield expresses a basic human need to be respected and feel empowered and free, even in a situation where she's not physically threatened, and the reason why she pulls it off perfectly is because of great editing and omission. If you add a specific detail in a song, then you're leaving it up to the listener to overanalyze the detail, for good or for bad; the listener is fully allowed to question why the detail exists in the first place and how the detail changes the perception of the entire situation. The verses above represent true mental restraint and a perilous balancing act, of giving just the right amount of detail to understand the story, the right amount to also empathize and inhabit the story, and the right words to convey a casual, modern tone. In "Sparks Fly" she sings the line, "Effort executed beautifully". Of course, that line isn't about the music; but it deserves to describe the music.

In "Sparks Fly", the narrator describes a feeling of release - a story that also contains one of my favorite misheard lyrics:

"We sat in the hot summer twilight,<br/>
Radio loud, amid the brim bite;<br/>
The cursed water is choppy and wild,<br/>
I jumped abruptly, unreconciled."

The third line is actually "The _Coosa_ water is choppy and wild", but I like my "interpretation" better - it represents a turning point, to me, of the narrator finally escaping fear by embracing it.

If one were to criticize the album, I think the most complaint would come from the second half of the album. There's great writing there, but tracks 7, 8, 9, 10 are alternations of mood, 7 and 9 energetic and brisk, 8 and 10 somber and slow; the narrative is lost somewhere there, not that it matters. As I said in the beginning of this article, one shouldn't look for a person in songs. What I really refer to is a _conceptual_ narrative, which is a progression of ideas. "No Question", at least for this listen, sounds like a bit of backtracking into "Brass Beam", and "Fade" crosspollinates with "A Little More", such that the only difference between those tracks is that they recount different anecdotes.

Well, whatever. I come from a literary perspective, and writers have the privilege of having lots of time to think things over and make things perfect (because they don't get paid for it anyway, hah). There's a rebuttal to that: "Perfect always takes so long, because it don't exist." (Rosenstock's "Worry." is worth discussion too.) When listening to "Out in the Storm", it comes alive to me, each and every time; rather than toying with my own memories, I always live through its lines as the track plays. That is sufficient greatness.
