I feel pretty lucky to have a Computer Science degree, especially during these times. Full disclosure: I'm a software developer by trade, which explains this _totally awesome_ and _impressive, technologically and design-wise_, website. I have a pretty good understanding of the technology that is becoming important in our lives, and so I don't get mystified by the speculation coming from a certain product (which is the best way to describe most software). But it's highly unlikely I would ever write a technology blog because they are as numerous as the stars, and used for all variety of reasons, genuine or deceitful, and I talk about current trends all the time with others anyway. I prefer talking about art because I find it more objective, hilariously enough. The furthest my real life and my articles have intersected is in the realm of video games, whose challenges I'm somewhat familiar with.

But there's a hot topic in software right now that intersects with art considerably: ChatGPT.

Really it's the projects of OpenAI generally, DALL-E included, which I had the pleasure of playing with last year to considerable mirth. For those not in the know, DALL-E and ChatGPT are probably the most popular projects coming from the OpenAI research lab, having made major headlines in 2022. The inputs of both projects are similar: one prompt, written in the writer's native language. DALL-E responds with several, AI-"generated" images matching the prompt's description, and ChatGPT responds with as much information as it thinks the prompter may desire.

ChatGPT advocates argue, rightly, that the program's true strength is not in the accuracy of the information it fetches, but that it can compile that information in a coherent way, in the prompter's native language. I will then speak only on the program's ability to write organized text, rather than any potential use as a search engine.

I'm not going to try to go into detail on how this all works. One, it's not my area of expertise, and two, I'm sure that will horribly bore the audience. I will explain the work as bluntly as possible. A regular development cycle would look something like: Researchers decide what they want their tool to do. They think of a decent model favoring some outcomes over others, and then work backwards and favor some methods over others. Then they get a _huge_ amount of data - for ChatGPT, let's say it's _every website ever, including Wikipedia, internet forums and news sites_ - put it through the model and see if they got what they wanted. If they don't get what they want, they tweak the model until they do.

That's it. It's just a tool. Compare it to the development of the hammer over the last few millenium - after hammering millions upon billions of nails, blacksmiths figured out what a hammer should ultimately be shaped in order to do its job right. The only difference is that AI is much, much faster. Feng-hsiung Hsu, a developer of Deep Blue, a supercomputer that defeated the contemporary champion at chess, says something in the preface to his book "Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess Champion" that was philosophically convinving to me: Deep Blue wasn't proof of the machine's intellect in terms of human intellect, but it was proof of a _different_ kind of intellect being developed, one who relied on sheer processing strength over reason, as demonstrated by its producing unusual moves even Kasparov hadn't encountered. In this sense, AI is extremely impressive, but it's not, and never will be, human, at this rate anyway, but it promises to be a fascinating organism inherently dependent on the human species. A crazy idea, really.

I recently had a conversation with a colleague about OpenAI's projects, after he, amusingly, tried to trick me by funneling my responses to ChatGPT and returning its responses back to me. His Turing test failed spectacularly after two prompts, and I didn't figure it out after the first because I was preparing for a meeting. We seriously contemplated whether DALL-E and ChatGPT could replace content creators.

Coincidentally, I also read <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/chat-gpt-what-do-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Cave's response</a> to a ChatGPT song written "in the style of Nick Cave". Nick's response is a bit flowery. He said it perfectly and succinctly in the first paragraph: "This song sucks."

The song does suck. Nick goes into the whole struggle of making art and how the struggle colors the ultimate work, but you know the song sucks by just looking at it. You get the gist of it immediately: the protagonist is a kind of hunter of the dark. And...? There is no detail that makes the song interesting. Nick admitted the line "I've got the fire of hell in my eyes" spoke to him, and it's kind of an interesting line.

It also asks the question of, "What even _is_ Nick Cave's style?"

Are the lyrics passable? Yeah, definitely. Are they good? as in, would they stand out in comparison to the other elements in a song (singing style, instrumentals)? Probably not. ChatGPT advocates would argue: That's not the point! The point was that the program responded coherently and accurately to the prompt. And that is indeed impressive.

What tends to fascinate people in art is contradiction, the clashing of elements so dissimilar that people wonder endlessly why the artist did so and so or reject it so entirely they shrug and move on to the next thing. That's a solid marker for knowing when you've got something special in your hands. ChatGPT, so far, is pretty predictable, and that's because it has no concept of contradiction, and no AI probably will, as they have no concept of truth.

I find it extremely unlikely a DALL-E painting would be presented in a museum _on its own merits_. I find it extremely unlikely a script written by ChatGPT would be shown in a film _on its own merits_. A lot of insanity goes into the making of art, that even a chaos coefficient couldn't replicate. I qualify this, because it would be genuinely interesting to see an exhibit with AI-generated art compared and contrasted with the original artist's. A museum should provoke questions: What did the program see in the original? Why did the program view their own work as acceptable? What does this imply for the artistic process?

The works will never be good on their own merit. It will probably always stay passable. That's what's scary and possibly revolutionary about this technology.

Mediocrity is the enemy of mankind. Things that are inoffensive and trivial are among the most dangerous to men, right up there with snakes and bears. Mediocrity is entirely undetectable and possesses the property of not attracting thought or analysis.

One will occasionally find in people a misconception on what an "economy" is. An economy doesn't describe merely what, how and why people buy and say. An economy more generally describes the activity of a people; it happens that one of the, if not _the_, most efficient and useful ways to describe an economy is through the dollar signs thrown around. One can't merely look at an economy as suppliers and producers, because it biases the observer into breaking it down into wants and needs. Rather than saying what a a person "wants", a more useful way to look at a product is to question who is "willing to buy", and who is "willing to allocate time to get, grow, or create it". An Oreo is at once one of the grossest confectionaries in the world, high in fat and sugar, and also readily available and satisfies the minimum of a person's craving for sweets. The fame and power of the product lays in its satisfying consumers at an immense volume. Which is pretty impressive.

ChatGPT can create convincing email scams for people who need only click once. It can start disinformation campaigns for people who do not fact-check. It can write passable academic essays for people uninterested in writing. The reason these are considerable issues, as compared to life before ChatGPT, is that actors can do so 1) quickly and 2) with virtually no effort. The scale of the problem would be the issue.

"High" art will not be challenged, but "lower" types of art will be threatened. Art is not just valued for its goodness. Art calms, art amuses, art encourages, advertises and propagandizes. DALL-E and ChatGPT excel in all of these functions.

For one, DALL-E will probably be good enough one day to generate home decoration, like wall art.

I publish anime reviews, so several people (well, given traffic, one or one-half or a negative of a person) will understand this example easily: if anyone has attended anime conventions, there is usually a space reserved for independent vendors. They sell products and artwork anime-fied. They sometimes take on-area commissions, drawing artwork for a buyer's original character (OC) or of a specific scenario with so-and-so anime character(s). Many are good artists. Some are great artists. However, the draw of the art is not on the art's "goodness", i.e. on its own merits, the draw is in how the art amuses, impresses and tantalizes the audience in the fantasy.

AI seriously threatens these vendors, all the more so because their content is not wholly original. AI threatens this entire industry of fandom, whose purchasing readiness is based more on how the content makes them feel over the goodness of the content. ChatGPT doesn't write half-bad fanfiction.

Industries operating on a higher, more formal scale can use DALL-E and ChatGPT to draft ideas. Drafts of artwork and scripts are extremely important as they lay a framework for something better to be created. Advertisers, for example, can feed prompts into DALL-E to come up with the prototype of a logo or a banner, or into ChatGPT to come up with the script for a commercial, much more quickly than a human and on a smaller budget. DALL-E can even create prototypes of an idea, providing a visual aid when a story is literally in its infancy. In fact, I do wonder if these types of programs may devour the careers of website designers.

I have asked ChatGPT to write a few scripts for me, which I add below. They're _bad_, but people may find it disturbing how the AI has understood the formula for a lot of Hollywood movies. I will add, the writing is better than the writing of most amateur writers, in my personal opinion, and there are a _lot_ of amateur writers. Put in someone's hands, they may actually be the platform for a true movie one day, maybe even a _good_ one.

The AI's power to simply create, cheaply, quickly and in great volumes, can overwhelm an industry of cheap, unexceptional labor, and it rests on the consumer's indifference to quality and the artist's personal details, if any.

The only thing to add is that even unexceptional labor is near and dear to us. First, this relatively small-scale labor is a platform for some artists to grow their careers. Second, even at this level people have meaningful connections, which may be just a small, quick conversation with an artisan, ultimately coloring the memories that go behind purchasing a product - and art operates primarily on the emotions behind human memory. Which makes me think these creative industries will not go away soon and entirely, though I am aware most people do not go to an independent woodworker for furniture and instead head to IKEA.

So people should not be worried for Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Murakami or Basquiat; Shakespeare, Kafka and Borges will be fine. I'm furthermore not sure who precisely should be worried, as people will risk life and limb to have the typical cadence and chaos of a human conversation rather than have the neat resolution that comes from a bot. It would only affect really, really boring work; I see articles saying it is used to write up real estate listings and fetch legal rules. The whole ChatGPT fervor confirms something of an axiom I have developed about AI and life in general: if you find yourself really bored with your day job, you should probably be a little worried.

<button><strong onclick="document.getElementById('harry-potter-fanfic').classList.toggle('hide')">Write Harry Potter fan fiction.</strong></button>

<p id="harry-potter-fanfic" class="hide">
Harry Potter sat in his office at the Ministry of Magic, staring at a blank piece of parchment on his desk. It had been five years since the defeat of Voldemort, and he was now the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The past few years had been challenging, as he worked to restore order and justice to the wizarding world.<br/><br/>
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. Harry sighed, wondering who could possibly be disturbing him now. "Come in," he called out.<br/><br/>
The door opened, revealing a young witch. She was shaking and looked terrified. "Mr. Potter," she said, her voice trembling. "I need your help."<br/><br/>
Harry leaned forward, intrigued. "What seems to be the problem?"<br/><br/>
The witch took a deep breath and then blurted out her story. "There's a monster on the loose, Mr. Potter. It's attacking witches and wizards in the countryside, and no one knows how to stop it."<br/><br/>
Harry was on his feet in an instant. He grabbed his wand and headed for the door. "I'll take care of it," he said, determination in his voice.<br/><br/>
He Apparated to the site of the first attack, a small cottage on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. As he approached, he could hear the sounds of battle - spells being cast and creatures growling. Harry raised his wand and stepped inside.<br/><br/>
The scene that greeted him was one of chaos. A large, serpent-like monster was thrashing about, its jaws snapping as it tried to attack the defenders. Harry recognized the creature immediately - it was a Basilisk, one of the deadliest creatures in the wizarding world.<br/><br/>
He didn't hesitate. With a shout of "Avada Kedavra!", he sent a jet of green light towards the creature. The Basilisk roared in pain, but it didn't stop. Harry cast spell after spell, but the creature was too powerful.<br/><br/>
Just as he was about to give up, he heard a voice in his head. "Harry, it's me - Dumbledore. I have a plan, but you have to trust me."<br/><br/>
Harry nodded, even though he knew Dumbledore was long gone. He closed his eyes and concentrated, allowing himself to be guided by the voice in his head. When he opened his eyes again, he saw that the Basilisk was staring at him, its gaze locked onto his.<br/><br/>
And then, with a mighty roar, the Basilisk vanished, swallowed up by a vortex that seemed to come from nowhere. Harry stood there, stunned, as the voice in his head chuckled.<br/><br/>
"Well done, Harry. The Basilisk is gone, but there will always be more dangers in the wizarding world. You must always be ready to face them, no matter what."<br/><br/>
Harry nodded, smiling. He knew that as long as he had the memories of his friends and mentors, he would never be alone. And with that, he turned and walked back into the sunlight, ready for whatever lay ahead.<br/><br/>
