In which Kendrick repeats a lot of things he had already been saying in his career.

And material Vince Staples has been mining in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramona_Park_Broke_My_Heart"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Staples_(album)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> albums.

Kendrick is probably the most interesting artist of his generation. He knows quite a lot. He is a chameleon of style. He is such a chameleon that I only like 1 out of his 4 albums, as of today.

"Section.80" and "M.A.A.D City" are cute, tired. "To Pimp a Butterfly" is bloated with ego - his commentary of culture is, of course, his and his only, regardless of his fans agreeing with him.

"DAMN." is a classic. I expected less from "The Heart Part 4" after listening to its sequel. It's as good as the day it came out. In it and the following album is a style that suits Kendrick very well: instrumentally, chopped, distorted, groovy, moody; lyrically, Kendrick takes his time, is specific, is personal, examines many stratum of society; in short, perfect arenas to use his voracious taste and talent to embody numerous perspectives and flesh out a world view, which served his stage persona of a prophet speaking in multiple tongues, creating memorable music as a result.

"The Heart Part 5" is some things: it's Kendrick sounding like Kendrick; it's Kendrick complaining some more. Listening to it, you say, "This is a Kendrick Lamar song." Not a good sign from an artist who has been more clever.

So. Going by the album's title ("Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers") I get the sense it will be funk-oriented. I get the sense it will be in the style of "To Pimp a Butterfly" i.e. more than a nod to black music and musicians of the past. I get the sense I won't like it. A bit of arrogance, on my part - a bit like Babe pointing his at-bats. But I don't really believe in the idea that someone's experience can be spoiled by a little bit of foresight. And I have been surprised many times before. Music begins at the hips, goes through the heart, before it is finally understood by the mind; it is our hope as human beings that we think things through before our emotions make play with us; and in this analogy we see that these "Heart" singles are secondary to the real thing.
