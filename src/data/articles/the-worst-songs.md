We're talking about weeb shit here, so stay clear if you're not interested.

Fine, I'm obsessed with [virtual youtubers](/gura-and-vtubing). I don't know why. Maybe I'm a pervert. As I had mentioned before, I find this type of entertainer fascinating. It's a fairly unglamorous kind of entertainment, without dress suits or stage lighting. Where a decade ago the public may have been obsessed with how an act looked, no one gives a shit about how the vtubers look (though some people really care about their avatars). For all we know, the whole thing is a joke and we humor these weird people with the notion that they are stars of a kind. But, that conclusion itself is interesting. Nevertheless, I'm genuinely curious as what kinds of expression will come from the medium.

That being said, after undergoing the dark night of the soul, I have come to realize something: these entertainers have made the worst music I've ever heard in my life.

Not "some". _The_ worst. By far. And I don't know if they intended to do so.

I'm generally uncomfortable criticizing something unless I can firmly set into words what my critique is. I will attempt to do so here, but the main motivation to write this is my journey staring into the abyss of how awful the music is. By every measure, it was extraordinary.

If you figured it out: yes, this was inspired by Calliope Mori's new album, "PHANTOMIME".

The premise of this write-up...and the thing I struggle to grapple with is...how can someone make an album when they can't sing?

To clarify what I mean: take ["DONMAI"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkEewrMG6ts&list=OLAK5uy_lBxM9ZYpYjOk1gZxnKqi1PyQryli1hLKQ&index=6) or ["Go-Getters"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz_Ho2u2Tyg&list=OLAK5uy_lBxM9ZYpYjOk1gZxnKqi1PyQryli1hLKQ&index=3). Or ["skeletons"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnDiq858jxo&list=PLDhajrZgo0TJAeF2iLfUivpaGMOya6Q9Y&index=8). Take the extra-goopy layer of autotune at the 1:52 mark of "DONMAI" - and yes, you _can_ hear it, because she can't hit that high note (you can almost hear the software putting a ceiling on her voice as the "singing" becomes screeching). "Go-Getters" is a great example of how whispering-when-you-want-to-growl is _not_ the means by which you add character or steam to a song. You're not [Amy Winehouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJAfLE39ZZ8&pp=ygUbYW15IHdpbmVob3VzZSBiYWNrIHRvIGJsYWNr). You're not [Adele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYEDA3JcQqw&pp=ygUZYWRlbGUgcm9sbGluZyBpbiB0aGUgZGVlcA%3D%3D). It's insulting to think otherwise (unless you are Adele, and there's the .00000001% chance you're reading this), and it's insulting to think through no effort on your own part that you can.

Singing is not the ability to sing well generally, it's to sing _well on the song_. That's the rub. Bob Dylan sings well _on his songs_. Joey Ramone sings well _on his songs_. Calliope does not sing well on her own songs.

I know the whole range of music, I do. Is it a brag? I dunno, when I think of all the music I've heard I only think of all the time that could have been spent doing something else. So I say it in earnest: I know a lot about music. There's the (in)famous performance of Chuck Berry, John Lennon, and Yoko Ono. [Give it a watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXgXviYAgPg&pp=ygUabWVtcGhpcyB0ZW5uZXNzZWUgeW9rbyBvbm8%3D). I myself don't hear anything bad, per se. In fact, I hear the uniqueness of Yoko's voice that she has cultivated throughout her career. Her shriek has layers to it, it has depth, and she's able to give it direction, she's able to direct it to a howl or a whisper. That's not nothing. That's skill.

When you listen to silence, for example, you hear silence. But when you hear hi-hats, drums, "orchestral" arrangements, you unconsciously imagine a bracing dance song. Is it because our brains are trained to think this way, or is there a part of our lizard brain that relates the quickened tempo, the volume, the violence to movement, to excitement, to energy? I'm tending toward the latter. And when these instrumentals lead you to caterwauling? It's like racing to find a dying animal.

It's the cleanliness and crispness of the instrumentals juxtaposed next to a voice that is anything but. Then this struggle is accentuated when one realizes that software is trying to cut out the edges of the voice when, surprise, the listener is quite able to imagine what isn't there, and in fact is forced to imagine it when the song _still_ doesn't sound right.

Yoko makes her way in and she promptly leaves. The entirety of "Go-Getters" is someone _pretending_ that they can stay on note, and _pretending_ their voice, juxtaposed to the instrumentals, deserves the spotlight.

Postprocessing is fine in two ways. It can be used aesthetically. It can also be used when the singer is not performing under the best of circumstances. I get it, the voice is an instrument, it doesn't perform great under every environment. Singing is also so nuanced that someone like me can obsess over every microsecond of it. I get it, the recording environment is not the same as the live environment.

This song is instructional in how autotune should _not_ be used. It can't make you hit a note. It can't help you keep up with the tempo. It can't change the actual timbre, the actual uniqueness of your voice. And if you're questioning these: why do you WANT TO?

["Cult Following"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbNF8FqzIMs&list=OLAK5uy_lBxM9ZYpYjOk1gZxnKqi1PyQryli1hLKQ&index=5) is the best song. It's certainly the most interesting song. It's basically [System of A Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSvFpBOe8eY&pp=ygUac3lzdGVtIG9mIGEgZG93biBjaG9wIHN1ZXk%3D). This is suitable for Calliope's voice. She has a deep, rich voice. So she should adapt to it. She shouldn't be making Korean-style pop. And let's be real, she doesn't even have the range to sing the deep ["OTONABLUE"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l446hUqQ7GY&pp=ygUJb3RvbmFibHVl). But range is not a requirement, it's merely a _tool_. This is the woman who [admires Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbu5NowJxgQ&pp=ygUMY2FsbGkgZW1pbmVt). One of the concepts of rap or rock is to make something beautiful out of something ugly. Here, she's sufficiently aggressive, she lets a certain aspect of her personality out. That's the point of music!

We haven't even reached the worst music yet. Oh, did you think Calliope was really the worst musician? Did you think I would write an article frivolously on the strengths and weaknesses of this particular record? We're not even staring at the dragon yet. No, no, no, true horror awaits.

I struggled with this album. I struggled with the personality of the artist. I struggled with their vanity. I struggled with the world's relationship to art. I needed a comparison to ground my conclusions. I then picked up an album I had listened to before, but had never really understood its ramifications: Hakos Baelz's "ZODIAC".

[Sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfjlIUPkSFo&list=PLEpjZ6a3i26fJUzS2W7OLs96D23MhqKLq&index=3) [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1BdX87wpes&list=PLEpjZ6a3i26fJUzS2W7OLs96D23MhqKLq&index=5) [yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcuGYBedbiU&list=PLEpjZ6a3i26fJUzS2W7OLs96D23MhqKLq&index=8). Have [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7qfYF3wZH4&list=PLEpjZ6a3i26fJUzS2W7OLs96D23MhqKLq&index=10).

When I get to the 0:23 mark of "Ohayo-EST Gozai-MASTER ♡", I cry. I cry from the pain of cringing so hard. I cry because I think, "Someone, some producer or audio engineer, or the talent themself, heard that 'SHAKING THE GROUND', and thought it was OK." I've lost my mind over those 2-3 seconds. I don't understand the motivation behind them.

You get the sense she was trying to do a Pitbull-esque switch-up of the beat, but when you realize she _can't rap_, as in, can't keep time with the music, and she's _saying_ "SHAKING THE GROUND" over what is required for the song, i.e. sing-saying it, you wonder, Why the fuck did this get made?

This is "Zodiac". This is the worst music I've ever heard.

Jake Paul is actually the worst part of ["It's Everyday Bro"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSlb1ezRqfA&pp=ygUWamFrZSBwYXVsIGV2ZXJ5ZGF5IGJybw%3D%3D). You can hear him audibly struggle to keep his breath up with the beat, and he's stilted. Nevertheless, the song's rappers get successively better, with the Spanish rappers being a welcomed surprise. B-.

Alison Gold's ["Chinese Food"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n49of3EbpR8&pp=ygUOYWxpc29uIGNoaW5lc2U%3D) is sung well, and it's funny. And she was like 11. B+.

Rebecca Black is having fun on ["Friday"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0&pp=ygUUcmViZWNjYSBibGFjayBmcmlkYXk%3D). B.

Singing is not a one-dimensional metric. Despite his labored breathing, Jake has technique and keeps up with the flow. Alison can hit the notes. Rebecca has charisma. Baelz has nothing, because she is _pretending_ to be a singer she is not.

Jake also had the wisdom to supplement his own singing with more talented rappers. He had the knowledge of what his voice could do. He had the knowledge that his song would sound better with other people. He has better taste. (I also laugh really, really hard at "Los Angeles, Cali boy, but I'm from Ohio though, white boy".)

The only thing that is admirable about the music is the sheer effort of will to make it, to ignore how it sounds, wrong notes and all, wrong voice and all, and wrong notes and wrong voice stealing all the wrong attention from the instrumentals, but you can't even admire it for that. All an audio engineer had to do was hit Record, and the talent arbitrarily decided which take was their favorite, because they were all bad. I guess you can admire the producer's professional conduct in their ability to smile and put out their hand for a check.

Duke Ellington, apocryphally, said, "There are only two kinds of music, the good music, and the other stuff." There's a bit of truth to the idea that anything uninteresting is bad, but music is more than that. More than any other art form, like film or literature, we feel music through our body. It possesses the incredible power to annoy us more than any other medium.

For example, I visibly cringe whenever - as often happens in New York - LMFAO's "Sexy and I Know It" plays. Or an Ed Sheeran song. I'm old enough to know why: my mind rejects the idea of the song, but my body wants to tap its foot. The cringing is a fighting response to preserve my identity and sanity. That is to say: they're not bad songs. They achieve their effect, it's just I, hipster that I am, don't want their effect to be achieved.

Perhaps I shall add onto the phony Ellington quote: bad music makes you think about everything that isn't the music. An Ed Sheeran song makes me wonder what trite romances go on in Ed Sheeran's head.

The twist: I actually love Baelz' "Zodiac" a lot. It's so bad it's good. It's right up there with Corey Feldman's ["Angelic 2 the Core"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Nu00pbLkw&list=PLHTo__bpnlYUMidAwAxD9H5OoQgpK5YnS). I think constantly who thought of "Fight Song", who thought of "RIDE", and I love to imagine what every collaborator is thinking.

Because -

\- and let me clarify, I like Baelz a lot as an entertainer, actually, so if she's reading this, this is the most passionate form of "tough love" that you will hear and not appreciate and I apologize ahead of time -

I can't imagine anyone thinking this isn't a joke, and that the whole idea of molding streamers into musicians, or pretending they're musicians, is not some postmodern level of absurdity.

And now we must address the "idol" part of the conversation.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol) will better describe what an idol is than I can. This is my take on it: there's a fair amount of pretending when it comes to an idol. It's Japanese so it probably doesn't translate exactly, but idols do make me think of the Biblical concept of idolatory, as in, my god is always right and can never do any wrong. The idol performs the part and the fans, in turn, performs their part of pretending their idol is performing the part. It's a fascinating social relationship that can only end in heartbreak, unless you the talent are very, very lucky.

Never minding what the appeal of a virtual idol is - and, really, as far as the term's roots to history, only Kizuna Ai, Hoshimachi Suisei, etc. can really be called virtual idols - we can analyze fairly correctly what motivates the creation of virtual idols. It's merchandising. You sell the likeness of the idol on keychains, in plushies, other shit. This is the uncomfortable truth to grapple with: the personality behind the avatar is unimportant compared to the _idea_ of the avatar. Companies want the actual talent to fit as much as possible as the "character" behind the avatar and get quite upset if they don't. Consequently, they train talent to fit the suit.

Did I say "suit"? It's the best analogy. Yes, this is literally becoming Disneyland. That is to say, the actors of Disneyland are quite talented people, and the experience of Disneyland is meticulously made, but we still recognize that Disney's strength lies not in the films Mickey Mouse is depicted in, but what Mickey Mouse _symbolizes_.

Here's another prediction for vtubers: the end goal will be to make amusement parks. Maybe not necessarily including actual, engineered rides, but exhibits with the character personalities who may not even be played by the original streamer. I mean, [Gura featured in a fucking aquarium](https://hololivepro.com/news_en/20231128-01-58/).

As I mull on this, I don't think this is a bad thing by any means. This is all part of the general internet-ization of culture. Things once constrained by geography are now given an address on the internet. Forums go into the internet, marketplaces go into the internet, and theme parks go into the internet. But for the time being, it's embarassing when the person and the symbol are one-to-one. Maybe all of their activity are 4D chess moves by Calliope and Baelz to finally become what they knew they were destined to be: mascots. Remember, Mickey Mouse [did disco once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TRi3TsrlA&list=PLWf-5FTYbpX--TUabDGuHFAiut34ja3zl). Mascots feel no shame so long as they extend their brand.

That's the disappointing thing to come out of this night of the soul. I realized I cannot separate the entertainer as an entertainer and as a musical artist. It's hard to comprehend Baelz with any sincerity anymore. The music is a bed for all their vices, as vanity, as greed, as sloth. And on contemplating these, I don't watch them anymore. This is pretty heartbreaking as a fan. (Then again, I'll be fine, I'll just get my entertainment elsewhere.)

I really love Advent, which consists of the talent Shiori Novella, Bijou Koseki, Nerissa Ravencroft and ... the dogs, I don't remember their names, and yes, no one told them their names are stupid. I think they're really great entertainers. They have something special and weird in their minds. They compose a genuinely unique type of entertainer I have never seen before and probably won't go anywhere. FUWAMOCO in particular fit the concept of virtual idols the best.

The moment they release music is the moment I'll feel shame for them. My bet is that Bijou is going to make an album. [She](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akn_Gdi05Ys) [can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfhJK602XdE) [sing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ7zNf82Zdk). But if any one of them has deluded themself in their ability to be an idol, not minding their ability to actually sing, it's Bijou.

That being said, Nerissa Ravencroft recently released [a pretty good dance EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_fkTc7Hlp0&list=OLAK5uy_kj9UFrjkLGkscXeNLZJfgOKADxOvDuTpY). She sounds great and the songs are shaped like songs. They're not real songs in that the lyrics don't _describe_ anything; they have what Gen Z-ers call "vibe". She could accomplish whatever it is that she's trying to express in fewer words and in stronger emotions.

I had the pleasure of listening to American radio recently and found a minor gem in Sabrina Carpenter. Give ["Please Please Please"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF1Na4AIecM&pp=ygUmcGxlYXNlIHBsZWFzZSBwbGVhc2Ugc2FicmluYSBjYXJwZW50ZXI%3D) a listen. This is a real song, and I can't think of anyone in recent memory who has Carpenter's charisma. In contrast, Nerissa's songs are hollow.

But do I give a shit? No, not really. Songs are felt in the hips, and you can dance to the EP. In fact, it's a well-constructed, if toothless, and somewhat rote, dance record. Thus, I say, she did a good job. I actually really like ["Sweetest Scarlet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLMlYZdynxE&list=OLAK5uy_kj9UFrjkLGkscXeNLZJfgOKADxOvDuTpY&index=2). Title's a mouthful, but I can look beyond the lyrics. The light rapping that bookends the verses is wonderfully executed and delightfully breaks up the generally-sedate pace of the song. The chorus pays off and meets the desired highs. If I understand her correctly, she gave the producers ideas for songs she wanted (I think she literally said that she ordered up a "girl-boss" song in "SHATTER"), so she just wrote the lyrics. This tracks as she didn't have much else to say on the songs' development. But an artist above all is a _tastemaker_. Even great artists, like Beyoncé, have rooms full of collaborators. Great artists, too, change their audience's tastes. It literally does not matter how you get what you get in a record, the ultimate result has to move the audience. Nerissa exhibited great taste in this EP. A-.

As much as I railed on the whole enterprise up 'til now, art has been made from these constraints. If you do not know who Hoshimachi Suisei is, you may have mistaken ["BIBBIDIBA"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZP5eqm4JqM&pp=ygUPc3Vpc2VpIGJpYmlkZWJh) as a real song, made by a real, veteran pop singer. But the endpoint is not always music. Houshou Marine is really leaning on the mascot route, but she's doing it her way. She has conceived this extremely weird, extremely specific, extremely horny, but highly popular character, and [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV-5W7SFHDc) [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfZR9jVP6tw) is really creative as a result. I say this not because I'm lazy: great artists put in a lot of effort, sure, but effort alone does not make an artist great. One must set one's own future. It's not enough to merely push through.

As an aside, I think, of English, Nanashi Mumei's ["mumei"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA0CpI0vCK4) is the best song released. She seemed to understand her singing is not always up to snuff to singing pop songs, so she subverted the assignment by making an EDM song. The layer of autotune is not a disguise, it's an aesthetic. Good on her.

We're still on track for [the future](/gura-and-vtubing) I predicted. With this write-up, I'm gathering closer to the idea that this is all a huge joke. But, by the efforts of extremely gifted individual talents, I'm also beginning to believe there's a beautiful vein of ore of expression here. The 2nd EN concert, which this write-up comes coolly from the heels of, was another joke, but less of one than the 1st concert, because of Advent, of course (yes, I'm an unabashed fan). By gum they can't sing and they can't dance, but they're happy to be there, and their joy infects the audience. It's also gratifying to see FUWAMOCO in their proper venue, when they've spent either a good chunk or their entire adult lives trying to be actual real Japanese idols. The power of this medium is that people who deserve to be on that stage can get on that stage regardless of their looks or background. The illness of this medium is that people who don't deserve ... The internet gave blessings and curses.

I will say this about Gura: she gave visibility to this whole fuckin' medium. Perhaps not singlehandedly, but her hand is heaviest. If she decides not to continue, it's up to her. The nice thing about her absence is that she has not given me anything to be ashamed of her. But I do miss her.

Addendum 10/10/24:

[Bijou's new song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3pjFfKBonI) is not bad. YUC'e had a good understanding of how to use the talent and what traits to emphasize and which to diminish. Fine; in hindsight, I was being extremely mean. I suppose if there are any good reasons to correct an article, it's to make an earnest attempt to apologize. Which means, of the aforementioned artists, the two are exceptionally delusional.
