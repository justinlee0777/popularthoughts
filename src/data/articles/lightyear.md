A Toy Story spin-off without toys nor even the particular toy presumably spun off from nor even the cultural context that defined that toy ("Toy Story" being a 90s film, likely inspired by the bravado and charisma of strictly the white masculine actor prototype) nor even the proper setting that that toy diegetically comes from (Buzz is more Flash Gordon than the Intersteller/Gunbuster influences of "Lightyear") nor, possibly most egregious of all, a character arc that in any way parallels the toy's over the course of four or so films, is aiming for the broad side of a barn and instead hitting a wet market in China, where the film is most certainly not going to show thus causing one to contemplate why the "artistic" decisions of the film were decided and not questioned, because, as much as we want to pretend to a purity in art, 200 million dollar films need to make their money back, which is why the starving artists go on starving: they have no intention of being responsible for the lives of hundreds or even thousands of coworkers on an idea which, while potentially great, may not make the investment back, and as a result stick to ideas that do not require costly routines, materials, skills i.e. state-of-the-art animation and Big Name cast.

But the big lesson, obscured by a smooch, historical spin-off sales, and "Jurassic World: Dominion", is twofold: one, most ideas are not inherently stupid, but this one is; and two, the team didn't understand the idea they were attempting to bring to life. There is no Buzz Lightyear as known in the film, not in character, not in concept, not in appearance, not even in personality. I can't even begin to understand the depression the marketers at Disney underwent. An original IP would have been preferred for a film in such utter indifference to the "Toy Story" brand, yet touting its flag all the same.

Whether to watch the film, is not the point I'm making; that is your decision to make, and hopefully you enjoy the film; for all the nerd hand-wringing done over the Star Wars franchise for the last decade, less on the art and, disappointingly, cynically on its market survivability, it would have been nice if a more mercenary, more opportunistic person architected "Lightyear" so as to make something masturbatorily memorable instead of something seemingly fated to pass out of the audience's minds.
