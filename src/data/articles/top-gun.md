A two and a half hour long movie with little in acting, characterization, plotting based on a movie that is viewed reverently without much reason for it is still, somehow and surprisingly, good; Tom Cruise is the star of an intellectual black hole; Miles Teller behind a mustache always worthy of mirth and more so the 3 million Cavill's was worth grunts, complains, otherwise does what Tom tells him to do in the movie <a href="/whiplash-film" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no different from J. K. Simmons</a>; which follows the same formula as the original except with far superior special effects (good) and a notable and subtle anti-bullying undercurrent what with diverse cast who yap at one another without any actual conflict (good for reasons I can't understand and actually tastefully done); the film is one layer about jets and another about human resilience, so safe to ignore the laughable dialogue; film should have been thirty minutes shorter, instead devoted essentially to Mission Impossible-esque escapades and old-plane porn; but somehow hard to knock the film; not sure if worth watching again for fighter sequences, but worth watching at least once, something I thought I'd never say.
