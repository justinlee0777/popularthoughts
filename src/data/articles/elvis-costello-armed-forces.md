It's a sad day in a life when one finds out they've grown old enough to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7k4GQSGvx8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this lady</a>.

However insecure I am about my position, I still maintain "<a href="/cyberpunk-edgerunners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>" is pointless, _corporate_ violence. That latter modifier is key.

Punk is not pointless. That is something I'd like to say, anyway. I do believe its point comes from its sheer existence, though I understand that is an ambiguous, and therefore tenuous, argument to make. But I do think it's true that, at least for those that have survived - any history of the underground scene will reveal dozens of acts where an eye wanted to inspect only one, as if a single roach reveals an infestation - punk does not necessarily have to be violent. It suffices to comment. Sometimes the threat of violence is necessary for comment, as a kind of exorcism. And the bourgeois audience of "Cyberpunk: Edgerunners" have all the wealth and resources they need to comment, and they do. We have heard from them enough. Once and for all, the vitality of punk is in surprise - whether it's Black Flag's rejection of hardcore's "faster is better" philosophy, Minutemen's embrace of jazz polyrhythms, or the Butthole Surfers' setting a cymbal on fire and tearing toys apart like police dogs on stage, the only acts that survive are surprising acts. (I think that is why the Post-Punk Revival didn't take. As good as the debuts of the Strokes, Interpol, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were, corporate sharks quickly followed up after them, and the whole thing eventually seemed inauthentic. But post-punk was brazen about its inauthenticity - people preferred it in subtle disguises, such as in the form of Arcade Fire.)

My mind goes off on tangents. It often bears ugly fruit. Here is one: The misery of "Edgerunners" made me think of Elvis Costello and the Attractions' "Radio Radio", a song once played as a huge middle finger to producer of "Saturday Night Live" Lorne Michaels, and which was an indictment against then-radio, commercialized and sanded of all controversy and therefore thinking, a situation that is increasingly relevant to the state of popular entertainment.

But never minding that, "Radio Radio" is Costello's unique brand of punk. It's not visceral nor is it rudimentary, but it's still very snotty and very cynical. It is true that Costello signed up to Columbia Records after "My Aim Is True", so perhaps he doesn't match up to punk's beer-soaked ceiling of DIY authenticity (though he must be quite acquainted with the smell), but goddamn is he a good artist. I liked the album succeeding that of "Radio Radio": where the Sex Pistols used outsider anarchy to critique society, Costello and the Attractions surprisingly used structure to battle against structure. "Armed Forces" is an IUD, blowing up their targets as a participant from the inside.

### Armed Forces

"Oh, I just don't know where to begin."

It's almost like Elvis anticipated and said my words before I could.

A million things have been said about the song. I'll merely highlight one verse.

There's so many fish in the sea<br/>
that only rise up in the sweat and smoke like mercury,<br/>
but they keep you hanging on;<br/>
they say you're so young,<br/>
your mind is made up, but your mouth is undone.

That particular bit about sweat and mercury, which evokes a near-hellish imagery, needs to be heard with Costello's smoky coo and slick inflection. The verse is teeming with contrasts: the sleek polish of fish scales against smoke, fish swimming in the sea against Elvis's being hung out to dry, and the mind against the carnal mouth.

It's a simple song where the execution is near-perfect. From Costello's account, the song's origin comes from women paying more attention to him as a result of his fame and the resultant "accidents" that are often the conclusions of such haphazard connections. In many ways, it's the perfect opener for the album due to its simplicity. The music will eventually involve more characters beyond Elvis and encompass more specific situations.

To tell you the truth though, it's "Senior Service" I really love, from when I first heard the song to this day.

There's something infinitely funny about the lines "Senior service, junior dissatisfaction - / though it may be second-hand, it's by no means second-rate." The studied, subdued rage simmering within the narrator doesn't catalyze and explode because he has accepted the constraints of public service. One could almost hear him grind his teeth out as he is refused promotion after promotion. It spills out in solipsistic rants:

I want your company car, I want your girlfriend and love,<br/>
I want your place at the bar, because there's always another man<br/>
to chop off your head, and watch it roll into the basket;<br/>
if you should drop off dead tonight, then they won't have to ask me twice.

Why does he endure it all? The bridge explains:

They took me in the office and told me very carefully<br/>
the way that I could benefit from death and disability.

It's just a damn funny song, and the characters rendered in it - our junior narrator, his hidden senior, and his hidden senior's girlfriend - come out vividly. There's not much more to it.

"Don't start me talking; / I can talk all night."

Fucker anticipated me again.

"Oliver's Army" may be my favorite Elvis Costello song of all time. Yes, I know it's his biggest radio hit. I'm sure that makes me a dork.

So he continues:

My mind goes sleepwalking<br/>
while I'm putting the world to right.

Which evokes similar imagery as <a href="/fugazi-argument" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fugazi's "The Kill"</a>, though with much more sarcasm.

"Call careers information - have you got yourself an occupation?" kicks off the narrative of the song. It's almost as if our narrator, whether sarcastic or serious, just woke up from a doze, and his automatic response, or solution, for any audience is to recommend them a job, which itself is a continuation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsE5NAAU39k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Clash's "Career Opportunities"</a>.

There was a Checkpoint Charlie;<br/>
He didn't crack a smile.<br/>
But it's no laughing party<br/>
when you've been on the murder mile;<br/>
only takes one itchy trigger:<br/>
one more widow, one less white nigger.

Apparently that last use of "nigger" is controversial, when the point is to emphasize that to the movers and shakers the life of a poor dirt farmer has a cost, which doesn't even touch the surface of their pocket. As for Checkpoint Charlie, I assume it's a reference to a famous crossing point between East and West Berlin, which again represents the heavy hand of the military in people's lives.

And then my favorite run of lines:

Hong Kong is up for grabs;<br/>
London is full of Arabs;<br/>
we can be in Palestine,<br/>
overrun by the Chinese line<br/>
with the boys in the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne;

But there's no danger!<br/>
It's a professional career!<br/>
Oh, it can be arranged<br/>
with just a word in Mister Churchill's ear!<br/>
If you're out of luck or out of work,<br/>
we can send you to Johannesburg.

Costello, who is acting as a military recruiter, or who is acting as a snotty critic acting as a military recruiter, is playing with the lives of nations, full of people and existing cultures, as if they were toy soldiers and airplanes - which toys he certainly believes, in his snottiest, the Prime Minister perceives his real flesh-and-blood men to be.

Ironically it's a magical song, full of adventure, much like the adventure kids playing pirate embark on. Of particular note is Steve Nieve's, a longtime Costello collaborator's, piano playing, gliding through the ebony and ivory as we move from one locale to the next, enticing the ear with exotic destinations that Costello reminds you are full of death, and demonstrating the fake triumph of the glar-ius British Army.

After our three-song racing streak of rock-ready songs, the album slows down a little with the beginning silence and cybernetic imagery of "Big Boys":

I am starting to function<br/>
in the usual way;<br/>
everything is so provocative -<br/>
very, very temporary...

Not the greatest song. At least it continues the theme from "Accidents Will Happen" - that of fumbling with the opposite gender, forcing oneself into trite, stupid routines of courtship while pretending that this is the behavior of a "normal" adult male.

"Green Shirt" continues the theme of mechanism a la <a href="/ending-of-brazil-1985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terry Gilliam's "Brazil"</a>, using surrealist imagery:

There's a smart young woman on a light blue screen<br/>
who comes into my house every night.<br/>
She takes all the red, yellow, orange and green<br/>
and turns them into black and white.

Possibly a reference to George Orwell's "1984", but it could simply be Costello's spinning a disconcerting mix of sensuality and submissiveness. The narrator is seduced into helplessness.

She's listening in on the Venus Line,<br/>
she's picking out names,<br/>
I hope none of them are mine.

Then a lovely bridge,

Never said I was a stool pigeon,<br/>
I never said I was a diplomat;<br/>
everybody is under suspicion<br/>
but you don't want to hear about that...

But you tease, and you flirt,<br/>
and you shine all the buttons on your green shirt.

I love this song, but it's somewhat difficult to unravel, especially since I am not sure what "Venus Line" refers to. What seizes the eye immediately is the taut narrative, conveying the story of a man harassed by a surveillance state. My guess, going by the album's themes up to this point, is that the song is about the use of sexuality, including the sensual glisten of buttons on a green shirt, to compel the narrator to make false confessions, essentially lying to save his own skin.

This sensuality then crescendoes into "Party Girl", where Costello finally reflects and attempts to examine the situation with some empathy for the female perspective - of course, his flaws not disappearing, he still reduces her:

They say you're nothing but a party girl,<br/>
just like a million more all over the world...<br/>
I know I shouldn't be raising my hopes so high,<br/>
but I have seen the hungry look in their eyes,<br/>
they'd settle for anything in disguise of love.<br/>

...

Give it just one more try,<br/>
Give it a chance;<br/>
Starts like fascination,<br/>
Ends up like a trance...

This brief bit of intrigue ultimately ends in Costello sighing, "Oh, you'll never be the guilty party, girl; / Maybe someday we'll go hiding from this world... \[...\] I don't want to lock you up and say you're mine."

I oddly don't like "Good Squad" all that much. I will briefly touch that it combines the threads begun in "Oliver's Army" and "Big Boys", associating conscription with the path to "maturity".

In hindsight, the B-side is a _little_ weak, definitely weaker than its flip. My favorite lines -

"Busy Bodies": "You want attention; / you try my patience; / with the best intentions you are nothing but a nuisance."

"Moods for Moderns": "What if none of your dreams come true?"

"Sunday's Best" is a little bit on the nose. It is perhaps best described by this famous quote of George Buchner: "The life of the rich is one long Sunday."

"Chemistry Class" I think is the one track in this album where Costello is just too clever for his own good, proving Robert Christgau's <a href="https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=elvis+costello" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consistent critique of him</a>. It's just too punny and at that point he has well worn out the theme of "playing" with girls and growing up.

So we come to the hidden gem, "Two Little Hitlers".

Why are we racing to be so old?<br/>
I'm up late pacing the floor, I won't be told<br/>
you have your reservations; I'm bought and sold.

"Two Little Hitlers" has a whole story in it. The young man of the album has grown up - finally stuck with one of the girls he has been playing around with, so that both act the Hitler to one another in unbreakable, eternal matrimony.

I'll face the music, I'll face the facts,<br/>
even when we walk in polka dots and checkered slacks,<br/>
bowing and squawking, running after tidbits,<br/>
bobbing and squinting, just like a nitwit.

Is there anything more satisfying than this imagery and rhythm? Costello paints our old, long-suffering couple, whose age has somehow devolved their fashion sense and concern for public etiquette.

I need my head examined,<br/>
I need my eyes excited,<br/>
I'd like to join the party,<br/>
but I was not invited;<br/>
you make a member of me,<br/>
I'll be delighted;

I wouldn't cry for lost souls who might drown:<br/>
dirty words for dirty minds written in a toilet town.

The variety in the use of word "I" - "I need", "I'd like", "I was", "I'll be" - rolls off the tongue and shows the bounciness of the conversation between him and his partner, the narrator placed into a tide of irreconciliable emotions, not unlike the forced confessions of "Green Shirt". Then that imagery of the bridge - "I wouldn't cry for lost souls who might drown", what a damn good line, and the subsequent line, "dirty words for dirty minds written in a toilet town," only proves that snobby disdain he has for anyone that is not himself.

For the fifth time on this trip, the narrator raises his voice in a rant:

A simple game of self-respect -<br/>
You flip the switch, and a world goes out.<br/>
Nobody jumps as you expect -<br/>
I thought you would have had enough by now.

Only for him to simmer down and mutter, as if stuck in a chair of the travel agency's,

You call selective dating for some effective mating.<br/>
I thought I'd let you down dear, but you were just deflated.<br/>
I knew right from the start, we'd end up hating.

Pictures of the merchandise plastered on the wall,<br/>
We can look so long as we don't have to talk at all.

The passive-aggressiveness of this latter couplet is just too hilarious.

This is my second-favorite song of the album; in a way, it's the "Man Out of Time" from "Imperial Bedroom". Costello attempts to create a human being out of the sufferer in the situations of the previous tracks, and in realizing this human being displays his whole story, his nervous tics, his failures, and his smartass-isms, especially in "He doesn't want your pleasure, he wants as no one can; / he wants all the names of all those he's better than." This is the culmination of the civilization he had been sneering at the whole album: it essentially produces the Woody Allen-esque neurotic, constantly arguing with his wife and finally broken in by his paycheck. The personal meets with the public, these two individuals cursed boors to the world of people.

The song may also be the reason why this may be my favorite of Costello's albums. Yes it's quite uneven, but this feels like one of the few times Costello actually finishes a character portrait, as he will again in <a href="/elvis-costello-get-happy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Get Happy!!"</a>. That, and, while "Get Happy!!" is more personal, I love the sniping of public institutions in this one.

This misery, ridiculous, yet very real in the Freudian universe of the mind, is cast aside as Costello makes an honest appeal to himself more than his audience at album's end. "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding" is the real reason why I wanted to write about "Armed Forces".

Played over a Springsteen-ian riff, conjuring images of "Born to Run", and Elvis's voice notably lower:

As I walk through<br/>
this wicked world,<br/>
searching for light in the darkness<br/>
of insanity,<br/>
I ask myself<br/>
Is all hope lost?<br/>
Is there only pain and hatred and misery?

A song written by Nick Lowe and released initially under the name of his band Brinsley Schwarz, there is not an ounce of Elvis Costello witticism here. There is finally only honesty and an appeal to an individual's rawer emotions. Cast away the learning, cast away the posturing, cast away the sneering and cast away the snark, and ask your inner self whether there is any happiness to be had for the individual and therefore the world.

The exercise is enough. By singing the song, we almost affirm that, yes, there can be peace, love and understanding, simply because we want it. And that, in a big way, is the power of punk.

There is a time we have to laugh at the world's absurdities, and even harden ourselves to the world's troubles, and there is a time to empathize and attempt to build bridges between disparate people. I'm not going to say when and how. It is okay to commiserate in our struggles with convention and with romance, but we do need to have a perspective on becoming better and progressing. The abject misery, misanthropy and hopelessness of "Edgerunners" whose only answer was a Bacchanalic orgy of violence against anyone and everyone were all the sadder because its creators were smirking and patting themselves all the way to the bank. Call me naive as Steve Nieve but true punk builds empathy, don't let the tough guy sneering fool you.
