Both ways of accessing the MFA's 2022 exhibition of Philip Guston's work are unique and excellent. From the hallway overlooking the _Tenshin-en_, it starts with Guston's later work, a fruition of a lifetime of work that feels distinctly and, humorously, his. I prefer the other entry. From the entrance opposite of Nishida Jun's slow-burn Zetsu series, you are first impressed by the immense "<a href="https://www.mfa.org/media/image/22661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Couple in Bed</a>", immense not because of the actual scale of canvas but because of the material: an artist, of massive shoes and an even more massive head, sleeping in an immaculate white sheet suspended in a black void. The subject's sanguine skin seems to denote an anxiety that, finally, has been allowed rest, which, having seen the full exhibit, will be well-deserved.

To the right of "Couple in Bed" is one of Guston's earlier works, "<a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/philip-guston/if-this-benoti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If This Be Not I</a>", painted at the ripe age of 32 (though one would learn Guston had been painting since he had been a teenager). Perhaps you may think, as I did, it was a little showy - kids in colorful clothing expressing dour looks, under the backdrop of a urban environment, may seem a little too easy as a subject for a painting. Further, you may continue thinking, no one child particularly stands out, and there's no chemistry among them.

Continuing onward you are treated to some Freudian paintings. Though there is nothing wrong with them.

As a result, you may be struck by, another early work, "<a href="https://www.mfa.org/media/image/22696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gladiators</a>" and its prior sketch, for a city mural. You're well-surprised - up to this point, you have seen the artist in bed painting children and abstractions. There is something about the use of shadow in "Gladiators" - I always pay attention to the nape of the largest figure, how the yellow converges around his neck and darkens, the shading of the hoplite's breast as his head hangs over it, and the back of the felled figure. In this way there is something dramatic about "Gladiators", and yet there is not, for the canvas essentially depicts a stalemate between anonymous, indeed deadpan combatants. There is something impersonal about this contortion of weapon and limb, though the subjects are boys, as if this is mere play with no actual consequences.

Endlessly fascinated with "Gladiators", you may look at "<a href="https://www.mfa.org/media/image/22681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aegean</a>", a late work, and merely shrug. "Nice watch."

Flanking the left of "Aegean", two depictions of a man falling ("Drawing for Bombardment", "Abandon Ship Drill"); you begin to think one of Guston's strengths is his dramatic composition, the particularly angular look of his human subjects. He reduces the human body to mere geometry which, in some odd way, heroizes his subject, makes them worthy of a dramatic lens.

Following this is a room of abstract paintings which I quite like but really have nothing much to say. Guston supposedly had two moods: bright, and bloody.

At the back of this room are miniatures of everyday objects. You learn that Guston had quite a bit of range - in fact, in contrast to his more complex, more traditional work, there was something elegant about his miniatures. Their crudity, his subjects' reduction, are intentional. But they amount to cute at best.

Then the earth-shaker: Guston's KKK paintings. You may circle this room, to better your understanding of Guston's oeuvre, everything done before and after; or you may circle the room in meditative awe.

Many of these paintings are dated around 1969 - for context, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in March of 1968. Riots preceded his death, and riots succeeded his death. Kennedy and Johnson's quite quaint domestic policy resolved into Nixon. Blood, blood, blood.

Let's start from the paintings on the right, impossible to pass by as one enters from the hallway. You are treated with "<a href="https://www.mfa.org/media/image/22651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Window</a>", teeming with square, almost plush, windows and, what appear to be, picture frames looking more like bath towels. It's hard to understand what makes this painting so captivating. We mind Guston's earlier-viewed abstract paintings and remark on the pink background, whose oil feels physical. Indeed, every whorl within every "window" demonstrates the artist's physical labor; our eyes are spellbound, turning around and around like his hand did. But we simply can't put our finger on the painting's geometric placement, nor on the brutal black slits across the whole canvas, most horizontal, looking back at us like eyes, a few vertical, specifically on the curtain's fringe (the curtain reduced to a roll of paper towels, apparently).

We move onto its sibling, "<a href="https://www.mfa.org/media/image/22676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City</a>", again more hypnotic geometry, again more primal pink, blood red, again more of those staring black slits. This is a paradise, specifically Lucifer's Pandaemonium, a series of domineering tyrannical buildings stretching toward infinity, but all so comically cute.

"<a href="https://collections.mfa.org/objects/35406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Deluge</a>", the quiet drowning of "City". The black is seeming silence. The ho-hum everyday objects float in the sea of death. The MFA points out one can see KKK hoods within the black through Guston's physical brushstrokes.

At this point, we're almost desensitized to the actual white hoods themselves, beginning with "<a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/94.432/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flatlands</a>" and ending with "<a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City Limits</a>". Their black slits have been staring at us this whole time. Their mountain-like white hoods have been looking down at us. And they... well, this is hard to say... they are just positively adorable.

The KKK do not arise to being human in Guston's paintings. Indeed, he has demonstrated that they are no different than the everyday objects around us. Perhaps it's a nihilistic view - I mean, I suppose an artist can depict any person as lifeless - but if seen with a closer eye, what Guston is really saying is that the moment the hood is put on, the person himself has made himself into an object. That is the very principle underpinning their vigilantism. They intentionally cease being people and instead become something other, something murderous and therefore inhuman.

Guston is most certainly taking a piss on the KKK. They _want_ to be intimidating. They _want_ to be associated with virility, masculinity. But they're so cute in their hoods! The contradiction is that their putting on their robes is like a child wearing their bedsheet to be a spooky ghost. It's all make-believe, but in spite of his mockery Guston directs you to what is human, or what is pathetically all too human.

His KKK drive around town. They <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/philip-guston/studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paint</a>. They smoke a lot of cigarettes. They are indeed people, yet people who have rejected their own humanity. Perhaps their misery with their everyday lives have caused them to wish for a rejection. They live cartoon worlds where they never really arise to being actualized, clarified as human beings ought to be.

These paintings too changed my interpretation of the earlier "If This Be Not I" and "Aegean". For Guston, you search for what is simple. In his simplicity is his raw human passion, and a devilish talent for geometry and color. In small and simple things Guston in effect recreates the world. The children in "If This Be Not I" are not subjects for a drama; they are themselves, they are playing new figures, wearing new masks (perhaps the dead child is playing dead). The interest is not in the canvas' entire composition, it is in the individual subjects' psychological interest. The urban environment is not haunting, it is just another playground. So too the brutal depiction of masculine, meaty arms of "Aegean" demonstrates the raw power, and the boyish posturing, between Greece and Turkey over the Aegean Sea.

So, if you had begun from my preferred entrance, after having thought a-plenty on Guston's oeuvre, you would now be seeing his late work, having a bit of a glimmer as to what makes him so characteristically him. He later took on the violence he depicted within other people upon himself.

The MFA's 2022 exhibition of Joseph Mallord William Turner's work resided in the basement-level Gund gallery, a subterranean space meant for darkness and quiet. The curators do whatever they want with this space - for Basquiat, they played 80s hip-hop music and 60s jazz, placing his work in contrasting black and white walls. Typically though most exhibitions are a milder affair. Turner's pieces were mildly presented; his paintings are dramatic enough.

His "<a href="https://collections.mfa.org/objects/31489#:~:text=Fall%20of%20the%20Rhine%20at%20Schaffhausen%20Joseph,Mallord%20William%20Turner%20%28English%2C%201775–1851%29%20about%201805–06" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fall of the Rhine at Schaffhausen</a>" is so powerful one has to deflect one's attention at the smaller pieces in the room before having a good look at it. Turner started very early; like Guston, he began drawing as a teenager. As a teen, his work is a little flat; it's very pretty, but nothing pops out. What stands out in "<a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner/the-pantheon-the-morning-after-the-fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pantheon, the Morning after the Fire</a>", an early work, are the icicles clinging to the burned building, whose thicknesses leap out from the rather ho-hum watercolor, in order to depict, in spite of the raging fire, it was a quite cold winter. By the time he turned 20, he was a bit brilliant. From here on out, he possessed an uncanny ability to depict landscapes and skies as rugged and wild.

You get lost in Turner's trees. His storms seize you. His trees feel like they are growing still before your eyes. We turn back to the Rhine. For depicting the Rhine's exultant crash, he thickens the water's spray, so it does seem like a physical object about to drop on the heads of his humans.

The mysteries of nature are at the forefront of Turner's paintings, even in "<a href="https://www.mfa.org/media/image/22046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Burning of the House of Lords and Commons</a>" and in "<a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/jmw-turner/joseph-mallord-william-turner-the-battle-of-fort-rock-val-daouste-piedmont-1796-r1147471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Battle of Fort Rock</a>". Even Napoleon looks tiny in "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War._The_Exile_and_the_Rock_Limpet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet</a>". In spite of our human activity, we are participants to nature, which is not simply the musings of a humble earth, but our human passions as well. For where do fires, where do roads come from?

Look at the former. Something that fascinated me is Turner's mysterious use of geometry, that bind his paintings together and make them so compelling for each re-view. Look at the direction of the fire; then look at the direction of the boats in the bottom-right corner of the painting. They're nearly parallel. On the left side of the painting is a detachment of people, some on the shore staring, others arcing away from them on more boats. Their direction parallels the upper left plumes of the fire, _and_ the billowing clouds in the upper right. Man imitates nature and nature imitates man.

Even in this, Turner's people are not really people. In fact, Turner's animals aren't even animals. This is evident in an early painting, a collabaration with Sawrey Gilpin, "<a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-donkeys-beside-a-mine-shaft-d04160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donkeys beside a Mine Shaft</a>". The donkeys look unusual because they are not Turner's donkeys; they have pathos, they have detail, they look rather silly in Turner's landscape which has more character.

The odd part is that Turner's sketches begin with people, and sometimes he is partcular about the direction they are looking in and the posture of their bodies. But once he starts a watercolor - and the MFA has a number of his incomplete canvases - the people almost disappear. He is more focused on the marrying, the mingling and fading of color, on the placement of his raging winds, shining suns, melancholy waves than the people, who appear like blobs.

And so Turner appeals strongly to our modern sensibility because his paintings are so dream-like. It is almost as if he were Mother Earth dreaming of human beings. In his paintings of war his eye is on the movement of armies and the wailing of widows, but he is not interested in any particular person, he is affected by the overall atmosphere.

To one exception.

### Slave Ship

Turner's "<a href="https://collections.mfa.org/objects/31102/slave-ship-slavers-throwing-overboard-the-dead-and-dying-t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slave Ship</a>" is an oddity. It is very yellow and red. This is uncharacteristic for him, in this exhbition anyway, as he prefers the tamer yellow, blue, white. Even in "The Field of Waterloo", he employs some black, but his sky is still blue, a little yellow from the dust of cannonade.

Not in "Slave Ship". He seems genuinely mad.

For a man whose entire life has been backgrounded with war (born in the middle of the American Revolution, was a teenager for the French Revolution, was an adult during the Napoleonic Wars) he never painted many apocalyptic paintings. He never seemed to be mad. He was often sad, at the least meditative, over the state of Europe.

The yellow with the core of white in "Slave Ship" is either a sun obscured by clouds or it is a flame. Surrounding it is a violent curve of red, marking blood. There are no lovely cloud formations, no _divertissement_ of white in the sky - everything in the upper half of the painting is flat, flat, flat except for that flame.

Then, everything can be said for the scene in the lower half. No more lovely whorls of white spray. The sea of blood. The sea of carnage. A sea of ravenous fish chewing on human bodies, fastened to what seem like comically large black manacles.

For Turner's slaves still do not seem to be people. Of note in the bottom right corner of the canvas, is an extremely large leg, whose thigh and calf do not look to be in proportion.

And yet the slaves of "Slave Ship" are somehow more human than the human subjects of his other paintings. It's odd, but it's hard to empathize wih the subjects of "<a href="https://www.mfa.org/media/image/22066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Field of Waterloo</a>". Their facial expressions convey little; they seem more tired than anything. Yet the outstretched hands of slaves communicate one thing clearly: "Oh God, help me." In this painting is the fear of drowning, the fear of devouring, the fear of destruction.

The geometry of the painting helps in this analysis too. Of easy note is the left side of the canvas: the waves at the bottom and the updraft of wind have similar arcs, paralleling the sudden surge of violence. The horizontality of the horizon and the seas depict a mocking calm. The hands of the slaves outstretched mirror vertically, and comically, the floated manacles - as well as the sails of the burning _Zong_, and, most importantly, the light at the center of the painting. The slaves beg for mercy from their former captives, and finally to the light of empyrean, God. They find none.

Above the light, is a clear white chaos residing in the upper right of the canvas, as if to indicate the meaninglessness of it all.

The oil is unusual in all of Turner's oeuvre, and yet it uses all of his skills masterfully. The exhibit overall shows Turner as a modest, meek, though a bit showy, but why not if so skilled? artist, gently mocking the subjects of his paintings - war, the decadence of Venice. He had acquired a familiarity and intimacy with his tools and his subjects. He even acquired some fondness for them. When we consider all the subjects _not_ in "Slave Ship", we understand whom it was he condemned.

In heaven, together,<br/>
Aureoles of light<br/>
Scratched footprints of white,<br/>
Converse how to color clouds<br/>
With gardening trowels.
