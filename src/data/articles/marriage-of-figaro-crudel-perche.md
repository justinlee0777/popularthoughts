I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### Mozart's Crudel! Perché Finora...

I listen to this aria so much I have multiple videos.

A rich hall, with two thrones, prepared for the wedding ceremony. The Count is making a final Hail Mary shot to woo Susanna. He does so by pouting. Nobility does not necessarily entail suaveness. To his surprise, Susanna relents and promises him one night. She answers, "Signor, la donna ognora / tempo ha dir di sì", meaning, "My lord, a woman always needs time to say Yes." I recall seeing lights at this place, white lights. I was there, hunched in the dark, in the midst of the crowd, watching the duet, but I was also somewhere else, bathed in a glowing light. That was the first and most recent time I died and went to heaven. Everything just felt, like, good, you know? By the duet's end I was back in the dark, as Susanna left the stage so that the Count can pout a bit more. I was back in this crappy, dirty, cold world. But I at least could forget about it a bit more with the remainder of the third and fourth acts.

I'm convinced I went to heaven, too, because it was a random aria. "Crudel! Perche finora ..." isn't even among the highlighted arias in this opera full of nothing but ... what is even the right adjective here? let's just understate by saying "memorable" ... arias, but it had been one I hadn't heard. "The Marriage of Figaro" is the reason why I try to make regular visits to the opera. I don't even remember why I began listening to it; my bet is that I heard the overture, and I accidentally allowed "Cinque...dieci...venti..." to play, which opened up this whole new world to me. I had listened to the first eight arias so. Much. It didn't matter if they couldn't surprise me anymore, for I was in love with them, and, in fact, every time I listen to them I'm still surprised precisely because I'm in love with them. I listened to Act I and II so much I didn't bother listening to Act III and IV. I thought, I have to leave something to be surprised by. Beside the relisten to "Porgi amor ...", which revealed how much I ignored the depth of the Countess's role the many listens before, "Perche! Crudel" was the first real shock I had watching this opera for the first time. Yes, yes, there is the "Deh vieni ..." but I knew about it ahead of time. For me and only me, "Perche! Crudel" revealed just how much music is allied to our conception of deity and how truly genius Mozart was, because it's just some song.

It's funny how little I care for Mozart's concertos and symphonies; it's his operas that strike me as divine and even an endpoint of music (of which there are an infinite many). I find the former bland, except for his very late symphonies, which contain a deep piety that Beethoven would exceed. I think the social opera suited him better than the hermetic symphony because Amadeus had a sense of humor and modesty concerning his work. Unlike Beethoven, he seemed to enjoy life, and enjoyment in his life mingled with enjoyment in his work.

It's no wonder, then, [the BBC determined "The Marriage of Figaro" as the greatest opera](https://www.classical-music.com/features/works/20-greatest-operas-all-time). From the very first aria to the last, the opera loves living. Certainly a large part of it comes from Lorenzo Da Ponte's libretto, but the opera is so much of Wolfgang's art, as can be heard in the overture, that famous so-fast-it's-breathless composition. Da Ponte's writing is quite funny, yet the following whirlwind of emotions comes from the music itself.

Look no further from the Count's first lines:

Crudel! Perché finora (Cruel one, why have you)<br/>
farmi languir così? (made me languish like this until now?)<br/>
Perché, crudel, (Why, cruel one,)<br/>
farmi languir così? (make me languish like this?)

Of obvious import in the pause is the second "crudel", as delimited by commas. The first "crudel" is sung in anger, and the second, because he is taking his time contemplating on it, is marked by bitterness and grief. The omission of the "finora" in the repetition is also critical: it demonstrates his anger is temporal, based precisely on their "promise". The lack of "finora" in the repetition shows the Count's grief is lifelong. Modern society would call him a toxic male, and I don't say this entirely in jest; as is evident in the rest of the opera, there's something seriously deficient within the Count, that this momentary obsession with Susanna is more like an illness than an evil. The repetition, I think, is entirely Mozart's invention.

To which Susanna replies,

Signor, la donna ognora (My lord, a woman always)<br/>
tempo ha dir di sì. (needs time before she says yes.)<br/>

Notice the strings. The violin is harsh and acerbic in the beginning of the aria, and churns when the Count begins his repetition. It's far more quiet when Susanna begins, allowing her lyrics to clear the room. Then there's that "Signor", along with the "nn" and "gn", that Susanna really wrings out, taking her sweet time to respond back to the Count. The reason is twofold: the first is that Susanna is lying and is actually reluctant to answer back to the Count, the second is to deceive him into thinking that, yes, it did take her a long time to think this through.

Count: Dunque, in giardin verrai? (Then you'll come into the garden?)<br/>
Susanna: Se piace a voi, verrò. (If it pleases you, I'll come.)<br/>
Count: E non mi mancherai? (You won't fail me?)<br/>
Susanna: No, non vi mancherò. (No, I won't fail you.)<br/>
Count: Verrai...<br/>
Susanna: Sì...<br/>
Count: Non mancherai...<br/>
Susanna: No...<br/>
Count: Non mancherai?<br/>
Susanna: No, non vi mancherò...<br/>
No, non vi mancherò.

These repetitions are really important to Mozart. He is transforming the lyrics into music. Story? Drama? Throw those out the window. They're unimportant. The only concern is that you _feel_ the lyrics. Heart comes before head. This is part of the magic of his operas: the singers are elevated from mere characters and become wind and essence, more than the things they have to say, becoming the feelings they are trying to embody.

That being said, it's funny how the Count approaches his courtship like a horny teenager. His words stalk Susanna like a predator, or perhaps more like a a dog who can't hiding the wagging of his tail. This is the magic of the repetition: though the words haven't changed much, via the singer's tone, you see his thoughts and lust eventually change into different streams.

Then, the best part of the song, sung by the Count - the lyrics I know by heart:

Mi sento dal contento (I feel happy,)<br/>
pieno di gioia il cor (my heart is full of joy)

accompanied by the strings and the winds welling, united at last. They depict real joy, after despair and rejection. Whenever I think of what happiness looks like, I think of the Count's roaring "Mi sento dal contento", and the image of his heart overflowing with joy along with the outpouring of music. It doesn't matter if his joy comes at the expense of evil, as is also the case with ["Nessun Dorma"](/giacomo-puccini-nessun-dorma).

Beneath the Count's outpouring of joy, Susanna mutters

Scusatemi se mento, (Forgive my deception,)<br/>
voi che intendete amor. (You who truly love.)

referring to her fiancé, the titular Figaro. The Count is so happy, transported in his mirth, that he repeats his lines.

It's difficult for me to describe what the strings are doing or conveying for the transition: they enter a jogging beat, as if giving wings to Susanna and the Count's (to-be) consummated love. If I had said before that the guitar introduces adventure, most recently in [ABBA's "Mamma Mia"](/abba-mamma-mia), these strings come really darn close, bearing the playful swagger normally seen in rock songs. The song ends with the duo repeating the promises they have made to one another, while making asides conveying their own emotions, the Count's puerile horniness, Susanna's immense regret.

This is as good as music gets. This is an endpoint in the art form. People like to say every second counts, but every second in "The Marriage of Figaro" does indeed bear significance, if not necessarily to the story then to the flow of the composition, the flow of how we, the audience, feel. I joked that we indulge ourselves with writing music after ABBA's "Mamma Mia". This is actually abundantly true with Mozart. He perfected the idea of opera as a book of _songs_. To him, the orchestra is a band, whose strength comes from harmony and collaboration. Opera later would become and currently is an _aural experience_, less song and more theater accompanied by music. Classical music later would come around to the idea of composer as _artist_, and sole tastemaker, as exemplified by Beethoven. We can approach Mozart, but we'll never touch him. He is the end. We must find new horizons.

I like to think often what Mozart would be if he were born into this era. "The Marriage of Figaro" is undeniably a pop songbook. We can only dream of writing songs with as much playfulness and variety as he did; it would improve the desert that has become modern radio, minus the occasional SZA song. I do think ABBA is closest to him. But, whenver I reach the end of this exercise, I shrug and say: That is the nature of genius, we can't guess what it will do. It's free to raise itself, and it's free to destroy itself, and, therefore, it is free to do nothing, nothing at all. And that's what Mozart's music conveys to me: the feeling of absolute freedom.
