I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### Wings' Band on the Run

I suppose, for all I make fun of doomers, I am a doomer myself, and I have one prophecy: we will one day live in a world where, when asked who the Beatles are, people will say "Who?" To the chagrin of some or many I myself am not really that much of a fan of The Beatles. I think I will fall in love with them later, or they will always be just fine for me. That being said, everything about The Beatles is interesting, even their music; clearly they're iconoclasts and innovators, you don't really have to like the music all that much. I do think John, George, Paul and Ringo were just at the cusp of television revolution, same as Elvis was for the radio (but obviously I'd have to research this). But the issue is that this only sates intellectual curiosity; this is not directly related to our love for beauty, which, at the moment, is somehow related to trap music. One of the more amusing exchanges I had recently was a Zoomer asserting maybe one or two Beatles songs, but not knowing who the band members were. Oh, it's definitely happening, and it'll be pretty funny. As for me, I'm not going to be offended when Generation Beta or whatever will assume ignorance on Nickelback.

I do think, of The Beatles, Paul is probably going to be the one who comes out of it the best, much to [Jann Wenner's displeasure](https://www.tumblr.com/longforyesterday/617679608895160320/among-those-determined-to-punish-mccartney-for-his). I say this because I like his music the most. Objectively speaking, he's the one who won because he's the one who lived (let's set aside Ringo, whose oeuvre I know little about, and whose name is way too close to a [1998 film's](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(film)>)). John, George and Paul were all extremely ambitious musicians, sterling in their own way, whose music were refractions of the unique color of their ambitions. I think, to tell the truth, as a subscriber to the theorum that musicians get better as they age, the post-Beatles work kicks the shit out of anything the band made, short of "Pepper", in at least cohesion. John was kind of a dick, but somehow being a dick made him write intensely intimate music. Though called the "quiet Beatle", George may have had the superior knack for making danceable music.

And Paul? Well, though John witheringly called Paul's songs "granny music", he made the most grandiose music out of all of them. It's bizarre how the Beatles embraced contradictions. It's not hard to see how the man who penned "When I'm Sixty-Four" also composed "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey" from 1971's "Ram", but it's also hard to divine how the same man wrote such fluid, changing music, roving from idea to idea without fretting.

I love "Band on the Run". It's a strange album, whose influences you can pinpoint - psychedelia, baroque, blues - and yet is none of them, it _is_. The culmination of half the band departing and an ill-fated, almost absurd trip to Lagos resulted in Paul writing nine beautiful stories in song form, in 41 minutes, to boot.

The titular song is a highlight, beginning with the lament:

Stuck inside these four walls...<br/>
Set aside for-ev-er...<br/>
Never seeing no one<br/>
nice again...<br/>
like you, mama.

This is one of Paul's particular charms, in The Beatles and after: his ability to humanize and normalize his singer. There's something about that "Never seeing no one / nice again / like you, mama" that feels like the natural expression of the sadness he is trying to depict. Paul, who wrote [lovely 30-second songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh1hKt5kQ_4&pp=ygUaaGVyIG1hamVzdHkgcGF1bCBtY2NhcnRuZXk%3D), really understood the brevity that needs to go behind sentence.

And just as like, the music shifts again, taking a more aggressive tone as an electric guitar purrs, Paul singing, "If I ever get out of here, / I'm going to give it all away, / to a registered charity," reflecting the anxious mutterings of his prisoner. The "registered charity" bit is funny - I'm pretty sure he thought this once as he went through the torture of being in The Beatles.

Then the music shifts _again_, to its final form, the acoustic guitar breaking through the orchestral swell:

And the rain exploded with a mighty crash,<br/>
as we fell into the sun;<br/>
and the first one said to the second one there,<br/>
"I hope you're having fun!"

That line, "first one said to the second one there", is so awkward and yet so flawless that you can't help but smile. And the line, "as we fell into the sun", is an epic line, beginning, finally, the Homeric journey of the Band on the Run.

I won't spoil the story - there's not much else to it, except a great guitar solo and a "country judge / who held a grudge" - so I will fixate on another lyric: "a bell was ringing in the village / for the rabbits on the run" is just great imagery, and a great way to keep up the energy of the story.

I think this is the (other) reason why Paul's music holds up the most, though I sense no lack of appetite for Lennon's sentimentalities: Paul's penchant to charm and amuse his audience is at the heart of being an entertainer. I'm constantly amazed by the glue that binds songs like "Mrs. Vandebilt" and "Picasso's Last Words", full of contrasting elements and different sorts of tension, together. Well, I guess that's what I'm looking for, anyway.

Something funny to note is that Tony Viscounti (THE Tony Viscounti if you're a fan of Bowie or T. Rex) never formally got credit for the 60-person orchestral arrangement for this track, which is amazing because so much of the life in the song comes from the arrangement. From what I know of Paul, this is rather in line with him - I think he's not a "details" person - but in another perspective this is fitting: as the song continues our protagonist loses his individual voice, and begins to personify the "band", journeying together. It stops being about one person; it's more about the heroic escape and the subsequent adventure. In real life, this is what Paul wanted when he banded together Wings and began touring college campuses again; hilariously, it happened he created, then, his best post-Beatles album, with Denny Laine, when he disposed of most of the band. Again, all of The Beatles are rather contradictory people.

Peter Jackson's 2021 documentary "The Beatles: Get Back" reveals that the making of 1970's "Let It Be" wasn't as acrimonious as was believed to be. It's a good reminder that we prefer to invent a narrative where there is no genuine understanding. I think I will choose not to look at The Beatles as talented musicians - _every_ great band is composed of multiple great musicians, when you really get to study them - but as extremely _ambitious_ musicians. I tried this thought exercise for fun: "What musicians, after their bands split up, went on to make really different music from their fellow bandmates?" So far, you can only name The Beatles, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Fleetwood Mac? Their shtick is fairly similar. Oasis? Liam and Noel, despite their famous tiff, have similar sounds, though of varying quality. Yorke and Greenwood's music mostly sounds like Radiohead's. Wu Tang, maybe, but they're so controlled by RZA. I think, mulling on it, Odd Future qualifies. For the rest, most bands hold on. For all the handwaving that humans are selfish and irreconcilable, people hold together, to make money. Not The Beatles. I think the idea that The Beatles hated each other was largely a misinterpretation of the fact that The Beatles hated the idea of being a part of the band called The Beatles when they were trying to move on with their lives; their hatred for the band was projected as a hatred of the band _members_, which the press gobbled up. Which is to say, The Beatles were composed of extremely audacious people, even compared to many other artists. You can have quibbles about their creative output, but you have to admire this gigantic quality of theirs.
