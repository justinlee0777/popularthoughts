"Gyo" is really about farting, isn't it?

I'm fuzzy on the details, but the VIZ Manga app no longer offers Shonen Jump series on subscription. Which works out for me in the long run: the current publication is boring, though I'll miss having "Hunter x Hunter", "Yu-Gi-Oh!" and Toriyama's works at my fingertips. I've also wanted to catch up with Rumiko Takahashi's "Mao" and dive into other series by publications with different audiences.

I actually pored through Kazuo Umezu's "Drifting Classroom" in a day. I'm not sure how I did it either. I wouldn't call "Drifting Classroom" perfect, but the nice thing about a classic is that it's sometimes ideal that it's not perfect. The main flaw is that you can see the seams of serialization - things need to happen, though sometimes they don't make perfect sense. I found it curious that there were constant leadership challenges in "Classroom", though some alternatives were far better than the others. And Umezu had to figure out how to keep those darn kids in the classroom, by handwaving the details of the ecological threat. And the ending is a little eye-rolling. _That_ things happen is nice, though. Umezu pays in the flaws so he can have a really rich, really creative story about despair, from two lenses: our world and the world of the apocalypse, because these two worlds are very much connected. There's no need to reiterate that the story is about the next generation paying a premium for the sins of the current generation; its exceptional quality comes from its perspective as a whole on humanity's placement in the universe and the species as a continuous, historical concept. And, in that sense, "Drifting Classroom" is horrifying, as horror shows us just how small and insignificant we are in the greater scheme of things.

I read through Junji Ito's "Gyo" with the same avidity - it's very short, so that helps - but for different reasons. Spoilers ahead.

When I got to the panel at the end of Chapter 11, where tubes are stuck up the butt of the constantly-farting woman to power a spider machine, I began laughing.

How is "Gyo" not a comedy?

The famous meme of Hayao Miyazaki and Ito depicts the former as a brooding cynic and the latter as smiling and lackadaisical. It's funny, and there's some truth to it, but I'll take Miyazaki's side. I do think the man is a true artist, in that the only worthy things he has to say are through his work, and you can tell, for him, this is certainly the case. His films are full of hope and beauty because he himself is a person who believes and tries to surround himself with that beauty, though he knows it is difficultly won. The only thing worth our consideration is hope, for a better world and to be better people. Miyazaki's anger and cynicism, in real life, come from people trading in hope and beauty for their own selfishness. He allows himself his ideal in his films, and his ideals strike him as true and good, but he is all too aware of our real human nature, which threaten to pour out of the seams of his films ("Porco Rosso", "Princess Mononoke", "The Wind Rises"). Miyazaki and Umezu are really not that different people, they only differ in what they choose to show.

Ito as well is not as innocent as he comes off to be, but I think he approaches his work differently. He is an entertainer foremost, and not an artist. Though by my saying that, I'm not establishing a black-and-white binary, nor am I saying one is better than the other. There is always a thin line. I pointed out the challenges of serialization in Umezu's "Drifting Classroom" above: clearly, Umezu needs to entertain his audience, and so he has to constantly create challenging scenarios. This will always be the case, forever and ever, with every manga. But before every artist you can see a road, and every once in a while the road opens up into a fork; you come to know who the artist is by analyzing their decisions in every fork they encounter. When Umezu had to figure out where to take the story, he chose the characters - the characters, first and foremost, have to guide the story to its conclusion.

Ito seems to do things that are the most fun, which is an approach I commend entirely, though sometimes the effect is jarring. For example, two women have a hair fight in "Uzumaki". Yes.

This is rather clear in "Gyo" when a shark attacks our protagonists early on in the plot. But as you continue onward in the series, you find out the shark has no reasons to attack out protagonists; in fact, it has less than no reason, because it's dead. Why did that happen? It made for a cool, tense scene, so whatever.

You begin to doubt Ito's intentions in a scene where our protagonist's girlfriend hangs herself, as a result of being disfigured from a virus (which also goes to show Junji Ito, indeed, finds fat people horrifying). Yet her swaying from the noose, hung from the ceiling lamp, is aided by her constant farting.

That's when I raised an eyebrow and wondered if Ito was the horror icon he's often made to be. The farting machine was a step too far. The nice thing about Ito is that he seems to be self-aware of his own qualities and is with you in your skepticism, as he introduces you to a fart circus. That's right, a circus where the orchestra is made from farts, a performer breathes fire with farts and, tada, a cannon is powered by a barrel of farts.

Ito even has his action movie moment of sentimentality when his dead girlfriend - capital-D Dead - shoves him aside with her spider leg, so he won't get hurt as she fights off a horde of farting spider walkers.

The problem with "Gyo" is that horror, in a significant sense, is local. As Americans this is understood immediately when you consider the paranormal movies here. "The Exorcist" is horror because it affects one little girl in one house; when the ghosts possess the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, then you get the "Ghostbusters". "Drifting Classroom" gets it, and "Dawn of the Dead" was wise for confining the situation to a mall. To have something threaten all of Japan and then the world diminishes the fear the protagonist is experiencing, because what does it matter if another body is added to the total count? (Unless the story plays with that concept.)

"Gyo" in my view is more of an action series, what with the protagonist doing rather heroic things. And I'm fairly certain Ito is aware of that. From "Gyo" and "Uzumaki", he doesn't seem to care much for genre at all.

Not that horror as a genre cares all that much for itself. "The Nightmare on Elm Street" series is successful in spite of Freddy Krueger mugging to the camera. Horror is better served if it was called "weird", because its primary fascination is with the unusual properties of the human body and mind and, therefore, the unusual quality of our very existence. Horror does not need to horrify, though being horrifying helps.

If we analyze it from that perspective, we do see an emergent theme in Ito's work: other people are the most horrifying thing we can encounter, because other people are _fucking weird_. A lot of Ito's work revolves around the family for that reason, as they are people you really can't avoid. Ito is amused by people's obsessions: the protagonist's girlfriend's obsession with smell in "Gyo", for example, and the protagonist's father's interest in spirals in the famous first chapter of "Uzumaki", which is genuinely horrifying. Part of that amusement comes from an inability to understand how that other person thinks and perceives. Ito's works can come off as funny for that reason, because he seems to ask the continual question of "Well, why?" - as well as, "Well, what next?"

(I want to add a small thought I had in "Uzumaki": he really abandons the plot of their trying to leave the town, even though the protagonist's boyfriend is entirely justified and they have ample evidence for doing so.)

I think the heart of "Gyo", that is muddled by the writing, is the deterioration of a couple's relationship based on her obsession. It began with the smell and, eventually, her own beauty as the virus took her over. I would love to ask Ito himself if the virus bloating the human body was an unconscious manifestation of his own mind, that love can end when one part of the relationship no longer finds the other attractive. As our hero says, his girlfriend doesn't really have any parents to go back to, so he wanted to take care of her. Our social bonds, in Ito's mind, are more invincible and infinite than even the greatest of cosmic horrors.

So the ending of "Gyo": even though our hero is more than justified in abandoning his girlfriend's spider-walking corpse, he goes out of his way to claim her body and bury her, despite putting himself into several deadly encounters. Before he joins a group of university students to find a cure for the virus, he looks out into the river and the sky with her corpse, finally able to rest with her.
