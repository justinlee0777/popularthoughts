I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### Elvis Costello's Don't Look Now

Welp, there were a lot of Virgo babies I wanted to address, but never got to. While we have a bit of a lull, let's tackle on two of 'em.

This is still my favorite Elvis Costello song, possibly because it hints at an Elvis we haven't seen yet. I've said before, in innumerable articles - man, I've written so much about Elvis Costello - that Elvis is precious and Elvis is flashy. But I don't view art as the author speaking directly to the audience; rather, all art is the artist wearing a guise, and that guise speaks to the audience. For many, the guise is themself; some people don't have much depth; but even where that the case, they are still wearing the guise of the self that they want the audience to see. In this, I can listen to Elvis' music and see the vulnerability that comes from the pretension and overuse of witty words. Whether he's aware of it or not is a different question.

But "Don't Look Now", on the cheekily-titled "Look Now", Elvis' _30th_ studio album, this time with The Imposters, is on a completely different mood. It's not flashy, but it's certainly precious, but the preciousness doesn't come from a sad sack, a loser, or, what Elvis is nowadays, a crooner, but from a _woman_. The narrator is, indeed, consciously making an attempt to be more clever than she actually is.

Oh wow! So this is one of the tracks co-written with Burt Bacharach. I always thought it was too simple to really belong to him.

I think one of the weaknesses of "Look Now" is that the songs are too much. For example, "Photographs Can Lie", another one co-written with Burt, is about a woman confronting the infidelities of her lover, but lyrically there are too many details, when this is the type of song that needs to be _emotionally_ felt. That was, of course, Burt's strength: he understood what was important in a song, directed laser-sharp focus on it, and eliminated everything else. Either Elvis allows himself to get distracted from the crucial point of the song, that is, the loss, or his voice does not have the emotional palette to sing them correctly. His Carole King collab, which had been kicking around since the beginning of the 2000s, suffers the same problem.

Perhaps the Atlantic is too wide a gulf. American songs appeal because we feel innocence, though we constantly find reasons why we shouldn't. King and Bacharach are truly singing to no one but themselves, which, in turn, means they are singing to you. The English have feelings in a prickly, guarded way, which is why we consider them smarter than us (that, and "Downton Abbey"). I do think Elvis runs right at that wall, that he is trying to say things in a subtle way when the strength of the crooner is that he isn't subtle, in fact the croon, the murmur, the whisper is the natural expression of someone who is down on his luck.

"Don't Look Now", by contrast, works beautifully and admirable. It's dead simple: two verses, two iterations of the chorus, clocking around 2 seconds shy of 2 and a half minutes. The audience does very little infering about the singer's circumstances, and there are only two characters, only one of whom speaks.

<p class="verse">Don't look now,
don't you dare,
I'm not decent,
go sit over there.
Would you rather I was dressed in priceless furs?
'Cause there's nothing left to wear.</p>

Of important note for Elvis, whose voice is so rarely defenestrated, is the way he sings "Would you rather", as if in timid frustration, as if in a deflating moment of honesty with the singer's object. I love how the lines open up word count-wise with those last two lines; parsimony of words is a parsimony of meaning, and saying more words, in this case, is the opposite.

<p class="verse">Don't look now,
I saw you shoot that glance,
I said "Don't peek"
at the sway of my dance,
and the length of my limb,
and the brush of my cheek;</p>

<p class="verse">okay, look at me now,
what do you see?</p>

Again, notice the elaboration, the play that comes with "sway of my dance, / and the length of my limb, / and the brush of my cheek". Continuing on from the line of thought from the last verse, the singer does not need to go into this level of detail at all; yet the words come, with the downturn of the eyes, the fluttering of the eyelashes, from the doubt she harbors in her lover's loving her, and her wanting him to love her. The singer knows she is under the lens of the male gaze, but she takes no offense to it.

That long exhale, "okay, look at me now, / what do you see?", is just so wonderfully done. Remember, Elvis had spent his young adulthood being the object of attention, of ridicule, and he responded with vitriole back. Here, that self-consciousness is brought into new light by his singing at this woman, where he doesn't respond with vengeance but with vulnerability, looking now for a little honesty.

And now, the chorus:

<p class="verse">I see you,
looking at me,
looking at how you're looking at me.</p>

This is poetry. This evokes, without the reader knowing it, the [Droste effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect), of an infinite recursion of images, until it seems time stops still, for time _has_ stopped still between these two. In these three lines you understand exactly what is being evoked.

<p class="verse">I know what you're thinking,
I can read your mind.
Oh, I promise,
I'll be good this time.</p>

<p class="verse">Now I wonder what you see,
will you be thinking of me?
Later on, when you're alone,
are you ever alone, in longing?</p>

In its own odd way, by how Elvis delivers that "I know what you're thinking", I myself can't tell what the singer is thinking. She seems absentminded, stuck in the middle of reality and daydream, which daydream is conveyed by the "Oh, I promise, / I'll be good this time," as if pantomiming how she'll act next.

The melancholy of that "Later on" haunts me. Though murmured, the passion in Elvis' voice is intense, and I too sometimes feel like these lines, waiting for love to consummate (in the purest sense of the word).

This is depth that does not need detail. This is desire that does not need to be shouted. And, I think, this is lyricism that does not need density. This is a side of Elvis that does not rely on his penmanship, but the _emotions_ and experiences he has developed over his many years. This may also be the best portrait he has painted, precisely because it is felt rather than seen.

I mentioned this in some form when I wrote about ["Get Happy!!"](/elvis-costello-get-happy). I may get around to the idea that "Imperial Bedroom" (1982), and not "Get Happy!!", not ["Armed Forces"](/elvis-costello-armed-forces), is his greatest album, even if incomplete. In "Bedroom", he is only sad, and I question whether that sadness has depth, but the capital-B Big argument is that, boy oh boy, does he give that sadness extreme breadth in 15 very, very different songs. What's incredible about "Bedroom" too is that in some tracks he's having _fun_ being sad ("Tears Before Bedtime", "...And In Every Home", "Little Savage", "You Little Fool").

I know the guy is old and he may not have that bitterness in his heart anymore, but I want him to return back to "Imperial Bedroom". I want him to explore the simple poetics of "Don't Look Now". I don't want "Imperial Bedroom" to be his capital-L Legacy, precisely because it's such a miserable, depressing, devastated album, and when listening to it you hear an Elvis who is completely defeated. (Why does it have to be so damn good?!?!) I would love Elvis to explore the character of "Don't Look Now" in this theoretical album, something akin to the characters Joni establishes in "The Hissing of Summer Lawns". Because I crave vulnerability, I crave philosophy, I crave the moment when an artist fashions a human out of words alone. Does that make me sick? Probably.

Or he could write a musical. That could be neat.
