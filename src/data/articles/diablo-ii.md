I'll agree that "Diablo II" is better than "Diablo III".

I got into "Diablo III" during the pandemic; I found killing monsters and gathering loot rather relaxing. I actually began on the PS3 and then moved over to the PS4. The PS3 could not download a specific patch that dramatically increased the drop of certain loot, for context. What was fun was finding certain legendary/set items that really made a skill set shine, empowering the player to kill monsters all the more easily.

I can't say whether the PS3 or the PS4 was more fun, on the basis of "struggle". Not only did the PS4 version have better loot drops, it also made the legendaries/set items much, much stronger. While it was fun getting specific effects through certain sets and seeing enemies melt, I missed acutely the experience of trying to get an extra mile out of my current build in the PS3 version. Furthermore, though I momentarily got into the numbers-game of increasing the Torment levels and the Greater Rift levels, it felt sort-of pointless going higher and higher at a certain point.

"Diablo II" is better, even if it is older, even if veteran Diablo fans are a little snobbish about it. Even from the beginning it's better. It seems like a slow game from the beginning, because of skill trees, but in truth you get a lot more mileage out of the skill trees than you do from the skills in III.

### Skill trees

Oh skill trees, are you not a relic of a simpler time? I think it was Yahtzee, long ago, who said the very concept of leveling up in an action-RPG is flawed, if not stupid. Your progress in the game is really just to suck a little less. Then there's the inherent balance issue with skill trees where each branch has to be somewhere equal to the other branches, to the point where you logically min-max a certain branch instead of diversifying across many branches.

If skill trees are to be replaced, we'll have to be extremely creative about them, as they exist because they're the simplest way to give the player a variety of options. Interestingly D&D 5e has a good approach with feats, but D&D has a way of making even the most useless feats fun to use.

"Diablo III" tried to get rid of skill trees by giving the player a whole backpack of skills, but this ultimately made the game very hard to balance. Each character gets around 20 _unique_ skills, I think, each mapped to 5 variations which may dramatically change how the skill works. So you technically get _100_ unique skills in "Diablo III". Wow, so impressive.

But the practical part of the brain realizes that no one is going to use the Witch Doctor's Sacrifice and almost everyone is going to use Piranhado. Everyone uses the same rune for Locust Swarm. When a new set comes out, everyone opts for the full 6-piece set benefit, rather than mixing and matching, and those skill/rune combinations become the new "thing". After a while, fatigue sets in, as you're doing the same thing over and over again.

In spite of what I've said, however, "Diablo II" does skill trees fine. Each skill is more-or-less unique and has a specific use in combat. Investing in one skill makes other skills in that branch more powerful.

You're still ultimately putting all your ducks in one basket (as the game is extremely frugal with skill resets) but at least leveling up means something even in the later levels.

Furthermore, because the strength of a skill is measured continously, your build does not become solely coupled to their equipment, so you're not waiting for a specific piece of gear to make a build viable. On the other end, however, a specific piece of equipment will limit what builds you'll want to choose, for example the Leaf staff in the early game. There is the pesky problem, though, of equipment that are generic "+X to all skills", which I'm not sure why you wouldn't ever use them. I'll address that later.

### Loot drop

There's just too much loot in "Diablo III", in the PS3 and in the PS4. Most equipment is useless because they have maybe one or two stats that are especially high, which are irrelevant in a game where the worst enemies are randomly generated. You're basically sifting through the crap and desperately searching for the things that give ridiculous boosts to your damage output. Increasing the amount of loot dropped is just a way to cope with it.

The loot drop rate in "Diablo II" is really not that bad. I didn't get the best equipment to drop on Nightmare difficulty, but I got pretty good loot to drop, even for characters I hadn't built yet, like Amazon and Paladin, such that I'm pretty excited to start a new game and try out these new characters.

I recall someone on some message board said that is one of the things that makes "Diablo II" work: legendary items are pretty good regardless of what level you are to use them, as they are loaded with stats that the player cares about, primarily in the form of skill increases.

The oddly nice thing is that a new piece of equipment would not dramatically make your build better, so you're not fishing for a specific one and cursing the game's RNG. (But I honestly have not gotten too deep into the endgame, so maybe it's atrocious in this regard.)

### Endgame

The progression of "Diablo II" is that you play the same campaign three times over in increasing levels of difficulty; Nightmare and Hell are actually, genuinely, _hard_, mostly because the monsters gain total resistance to certain damage types. When you reach Nightmare, you pretty much have to _know_ the levels to survive, with the proper resistances and skills.

"Diablo III" has a weird, not-really progression where you can go higher in level difficulty (via Torment levels) or try to beat higher Greater Rifts. All of the enemies are randomly generated so really a stronger enemy is one that hits harder and soaks more damage. And if an enemy is too hard, you can always just... back out.

Overall, "Diablo III" involves you in this vainglorious struggle for "better loot", for the purpose of only killing monsters all the more easily, which is therapeutic, but meaningless after a while. "Diablo II" is a bit more like a game in that you have to accomplish an objective with a limited set of gear.

### The Folly of Too Many

I might not be painting the most positive portrait of _either_ game, to be honest. As much as I like both games, and how much I've played both games, there should be something fundamental to a game that draws the player in. The whole kill-monsters-get-better reward loop is a rather false reward mechanism. People have tried to reach the logical endpoint of this concept by <a href="/risk-of-rain-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">auto-generating levels and monsters until the player reaches peak reward</a>.

So it can be forgiven if Blizzard opted for more randomness, since the whole industry was going that way anyway. But once you reach the ultimate conclusion, you just get games that kind of go nowhere and become an immemorable haze with few points worth remembering. I actually don't remember much of "Diablo III" anymore except when I got a pretty enjoyable build to play.

Generally speaking, the industry seems to have given up on the concept of RPG games. The "Final Fantasy" series has given itself up to spectacle entirely. There are small developers like Red Hook Studios making games like "Darkest Dungeon", a well-crafted RPG game. But it feels like the "leveling" aspect of all games is secondary to some other gimmick.

One of the great philosophical questions of game design is "Why have levels at all?" Why measure the player's skill in continuous units in the first place? I think the best answer is "Bloodborne's": levels are basically to make the player's life easier. If a boss is particularly hard, the player can invest in some points to make an encounter _slightly_ easier.

Otherwise, it's to give the player a false sense of choice. Levels seem to always disguise the fact that the combat system itself is not terribly enjoyable. Developers, logically, try to obfuscate the lack of choice with _many_ choices which, when reasoned by a rational person, are no choices at all.

The great challenge then is to create a game where the leveling _itself_ is rewarding or logically prove that leveling is always a secondary aspect of a game, and must always be. There's something quite valuable in concluding that leveling is a means _only_ to a goal, and is interchangeable with something else.

That being said, "Diablo II" at least has a better argument for levels, over the level-less "Diablo III".
