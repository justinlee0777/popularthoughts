I'm not a big fan of horror. I'm not sure what the genre is meant for. I don't like being scared or creeped out - I like sleeping, quite frankly - and so I never really understood what the purpose of watching scary things was. So take the following essay with a grain of salt.

I scare easily, but growing older I've become extremely interested in two things: missing person cases and creepypasta. Of the latter, these seem to be the exemplars of the genre: the famous "Candle Cove" - encountered when I was very young, and has caused many a sleepless night - the now famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4dGpz6cnHo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backrooms found footage</a>, and the not-creepypasta r/NoSleep "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3iex1h/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm a Search and Rescue Officer...</a>". Then there's this little <a href="https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Wake_Up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-paragraph gem</a> that still haunts me.

But the best creepypasta, hands down, has to be "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Petscop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Petscop</a>".

Nowadays Let's Plays of videogames are meant for two purposes: entertainment and education. But in the past, people did Let's Plays largely for the latter and slightly...because. Looking through the old <a href="https://lparchive.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Something Awful archive</a>, you'll find lots of astoundingly funny Let's Plays - Slowbeef and Diabetus playing Metroid and Chip Cheezum and General Ironicus's "50 Cent: Blood on the Sand" ("YO 50!", "Bitch took my skull!") ranking among them. (I think the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TippingForties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TippingForties'</a> "Final Fantasy X" and "Metal Gear Solid IV" used to appear in the archive but I believe they had a falling out with the Something Awful forum because they were moving from the largely-educational-sometimes-entertaining format to largely-entertaining, evident by the end of MGS-IV playthrough where they get really, really drunk, call Zero, who barely appears in the game, alternately "that dickhead", "that cocksucker", and "Franklin Roosevelt", to which Mike belts out "ROLLIO POLIO" then blacks out. I miss those guys.)

Let's Plays began as a niche before video games took off into popular culture; nerds made them, nerds loved them, and nerds argued over them. They were prototypical video game critics, in the best way - rather than writing about their experiences they actually showed them, and gave concrete evidence for their complaints. And they showed how one loves video games, by playing them, and playing them very well, in some instances.

For this reason, "Petscop" is perfect. The fictional, titular "Petscop" is an unreleased Playstation game developed supposedly by the company Garalina. Our narrator, a naturally curious gamer and perhaps game archivist, just wants to show it off. As a Let's Player, he knows that games are finite - they have patterns, are beatable, and are even exploitable. In the first episode, our narrator is simply trying to beat the game, noting several aspects of game design. He goes from puzzle to puzzle, collecting some kind of weird in-game currency and trying to catch "pets". Several inconsistencies in stage design are pointed out.

Ever the intrepid explorer of the game's world, he reads a note coming with the game, written by perhaps another player, and follows its instructions.

Upon following the instructions, the game's background music ends. We feel a sense of unease, but our narrator remarking on the music stopping comforts us. We're left only with the in-game character traveling for what feels like an eternity, and the uncomfortable squeaks of his footsteps.

He walks out from a brick building, alone in a green field blanketed in darkness. As our narrator walks through it he finds, for the first time, a wooden cellar door in the middle of nowhere, which he cannot open. But ever the gamer, he wants to soldier onwards and asks his audience for any advice on how to proceed.

Thus begins a long odyssey into the lonely, dark corridors hiding underneath the cheerful cartoon facade of "Petscop", which can only be described as subterranean in two respects: subterranean literally, and subterranean in terms of the game's code and apparent design, which no logic can seemingly penetrate.

And I need to point out the game's code and design, as it _was_ a game developed in C++, not just animation. The game's aesthetic, from level design, puzzles, even music, is consistent regardless of where our narrator goes. The game is just simply a _game_, meant to be played, rather than a device to scare people. The attention to detail on the real-life author's, Tony Domenico's, part can't be understated.

In all this, our narrator, in comparison to virtually all creepypastas, actually emerges as a _hero_. Creepypastas are in a way influenced by Lovecraftian horror, which highlights man's impotence against the invisible, unknowable influences of external forces. But the Let's Player of "Petscop" actually has positive qualities and has agency - he is brave and, to the audience's delight, he is unflappable. The things that he sees would cause in anyone anxiety, and for a number of disturbing details he laughs them off (see: the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/teJDdkWHAdw?t=281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"That's a dead kid"</a>, the very understated <a href="https://youtu.be/c_zCl8GV_dE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Well that was a lot of fun"</a>). As disturbing as the game is, he is endlessly curious about it, in a scientific way. In him is a genuinely pioneer spirit. In virtually all video game Let's Plays, the author has to resort to the game being "possessed" or "sentient" in order to compel the protagonist to keep playing. Yet in "Petscop", because our protagonist is so calm, we want to continue exploring the world with him. We actually empathize with him.

### Petscop spoilers

But one of the flaws of the series is that episode 10 or 11 brings in the concept of multiplayer - that multiple people can interact with the same world at the same time. That ruins the atmosphere of loneliness and illogic in the game, for me. What makes video game creepypastas especially compelling is the player's singular experience, something which I touched on when I discussed <a href="/elden-ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Skyrim" and "Elden Ring"</a>. It's hard to describe what you yourself saw in a game unless something else can visually see it. Up to a point, the narrator was never really sure if the oddities of the game were directed specifically to him or just part of its twisted logic. This is best exemplified by the heart-stopping <a href="https://youtu.be/teJDdkWHAdw?t=561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mirror scene</a>, a very small, subtle moment where the audience is pleading with the game to just make sense, in terms of a glitch.

But multiple perspectives means the game is either an objective experience or is in fact an experience tailored for each player. This ruins the dream-like impression of the earlier videos, as dreams fundamentally cannot be shared.

### Creepiness

"Petscop" revealed a fundamental property of creepy things in general: what makes certain things scary is not that they necessarily connote violence or death, but that they are simply just bizarre and non-understandable.

Take for example one of the most intriguing missing person cases, the Yuba County Five. Five men who were supposed to drive home after a basketball game inexplicably were found dead in a forest, one in a trailer maintained by the Forest Service, the rest found kilometers from one another scattered throughout the forest. Even odder, they were _apparently_ seen driving up a mountain on the day they disappeared, for unknown reasons.

After thinking substantially on it, what filled me with dread was not knowing what happened to them - and not knowing what would happen to me if I were, out of nowhere, put into the same situation. It's the _not-knowing_ that is scary, that may imply violence, may imply pain, but without any further facts _means_ nothing.

Take "Candle Cove", for instance. At the end of the story, you're not feeling chilly because you're wondering what the origin of the television broadcast was; you're feeling chilly because you're not sure whether you'll encounter something just as strange as that. The moment the explanation is supernatural, we feel we have finally landed in the realm of fiction and can safely ignore it - if the source is invented, we know it can't hurt us; if the source is real, then we plan accordingly for it. It's not a question of _why_, it's _that_. People have the sense the world works by random rules but, alas, because they are random, they are very difficult to reason with.

Human beings are naturally ordered; we prefer order over chaos; if we desire chaos, we make a routine of it, so that seemingly "random" behavior has preplanned triggers; fears and neuroses come from when we feel we are losing control of order, and in order to return back to order we revert to the neurotic behavior.

That fundamental struggle of order versus chaos is what makes these creepy stories work. In cold cases, in creepypasta, in SCP, there is an attempt to make sense of something that is outside of our realm of understanding. We must feel it _can_ make sense, on hinging upon one assumption becoming fact, though such a thing never happens.

Domenico's mentiong David Lynch's "<a href="https://egmnow.com/theres-something-hiding-in-petscop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inland Empire</a>" really adds onto that. David Lynch's oeuvre is more strange than scary, and you often find yourself laughing at them. I recall David Lynch complained during the production of the last season of "Twin Peaks" that his team was not allowed to be "dreamy" - mysterious word, but the word perfectly describes his artistry and the human connection in his films. There is some sinister shadow that the human psyche throws; under the shadow, we are oppressed by the immense cloud that we cannot control, but once we are over the shadow everything becomes explicable. But it's the depiction of that shadow that is important.

And when it comes down to it, these creepy stories are about life and its mysteries, which may sometimes illuminate its beauty to us, and sometimes leave us scratching our heads, which they ought to, as otherwise life would not be so beautiful. We must go down, and come to understand some of the brutality of the earth before we see things in a different light. "Petscop", although flawed, is the perfect labyrinth in that regard, whose walls lead us into dead-end after dead-end though we believe, in our diseased minds, we finally see a light. And because Domenico never reveals the underlying motivation beneath "Petscop", indeed in interviews approaches the subject as an art work, this is easily, easily, easily the most rewatchable creepypasta I've encountered yet, if not for music and sound alone.

### Addendum: Video games as sub-reality

"Petscop" throws an interesting light on video games as a concept. As stated above, what makes it frightening is that it exploits our need for order, giving us none.

Within the pages of the book and the confines of the canvas, we see whatever the artist wants us to see - the artist is omnipotent and therefore our sense of order is their sense of order. A single rule persists in film and in music: the content lies on a strictly temporal scale. Information is doled out by the perceptual millisecond. This rule is inviolable by the artist, and I think this is why horror has been more interesting in those genres than in the former two. ("<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A62Z_08sg38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homotopy to Marie</a>" and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_dXp0eF8s0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frankie Teardrop</a>" are excellent examples of the use of tension in music.)

Video games require even more rules and, for that reason, may be even better at horror, depending on how it is employed. People still talk of the famous sanity effects in "Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem" which violate the shared agreement of the game's rules between the artists and the audience. A game essentially encapsulates a subset of reality; though the player interacts with the game through their controller or their keyboard, they still bring in assumptions from our reality into the screen. Even in the most fanciful of games, such as "Super Mario Bros", the concept of gravity is retained.

The reason why this famous <a href="https://lparchive.org/Animal-Crossing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Animal Crossing" Let's Play</a> works is because the author manipulates that reality. Whereas you are intended to jump from one reality downwards to another, smaller one, the author combines the two realities, taking the joke of "What if a real kid actually went in the world of 'Animal Crossing'?" to its full extent. The colorful, play-pretend appearance of the games is clashed by the protagonist's internal thoughts which contain real concerns. Perhaps the story's resolution is overdramatic, but, then again, that's probably the point. It's stupid turtles all the way down.

In particular, video games have been an especially fertile ground for creepypastas, with "Ben Drowned" being prominent.

It's an interesting thought, but I don't know what it leads to. The idea advocates a "meta" approach to video game development, like "Doki Doki Literature Club!".

An interesting trend can be observed in games like "Phasmophobia" and "The Mortuary Assistant", where the player is intended to record unusual phenomena in order to beat them. Yet after the initial shock, the phenomena are just that: unusual, and then, within the game's sub-reality, normal (as the sub-reality is also an extreme subset of possible phenomena, too).

So for the time being, until some intrepid video game artist experiments with it, this observation is a cause for joy for storytellers of creepy stories only.
