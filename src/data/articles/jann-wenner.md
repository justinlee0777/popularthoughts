Well, let's keep this short.

If you were to tell me that John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, Mick Jagger and Pete Townshend were the "masters" - never mind "philosophers", whatever that means - I would say, "OK." Because that's a fair argument. Those may be the biggest names in rock n' roll, so I assume your criteria were media coverage, audience size, ubiquity etc. and not necessarily on the music itself. Fair enough. I will note that you did not mention Brian Wilson, Gene Clark (of the Byrds), Eric Clapton, Lou Reed or Syd Barrett, who are also white musicians.

Adding Bono and Springsteen to the group automatically makes it a bad take. A really bad one. Like, objectively and absolutely.

Because Bono and Springsteen developed in the '80s. The rest are from the '60s. If you know a lick of musical history, your brain is falling apart trying to put it all together.

You chose Bono and Springsteen, but not Eddie Van Halen? Ozzy? FREDDIE FUCKING MERCURY?

I also think you're clearly joking if you exclude Joe Strummer as a philosopher. Johnny Rotten, I kinda get, but it's a stretch. What about Kurt Cobain? When does time end?

That's the real issue I have with the list: that the entries seemed arbitrarily decided i.e. they're comprised of Wenner's friends. Which is fine, but he shouldn't have pretended to be a critic and dressed his friends up as "philosophers of rock n' roll". He should have made a book about his friends.

Listen, Joni Mitchell didn't have the greatest popularity in the '60s. I love Joni Mitchell, unabashedly too. Her strongest material came in the middle of the '70s. The mythology of rock comes from the '60s. I get it.

But it's extremely, EXTREMELY odd to think JIMI HENDRIX did not contribute, at all, to the philosophy of rock. It's odd Wenner didn't even mention him in the [New York Times interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/arts/jann-wenner-the-masters-interview.html). He's one of the most promiment images of the hippie movement.

I personally think he deserved to be fired because of how extremely bad his take is. It's a little like a chef thinking the mold adds flavor. It calls into question every decision he has made in the past. And I don't think he's a racist or a sexist, based on that interview alone. But he is wrong.

Not that the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame isn't a huge joke already. His reputation ameliorated after being kicked out. How do you have a canon for rock n' roll that includes NWA and not Oasis or The Smashing Pumpkins? My personal pet peeves are Hole and King Crimson; Courtney Love is rock as fuck. So, off with it; Jann Wenner, whatever, Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, go fuck yourself.
