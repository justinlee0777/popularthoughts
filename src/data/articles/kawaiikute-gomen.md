I've given myself the task of writing about one song a week for 2024 because, well, I think it'd be fun.

### HoneyWorks' Kawaikute Gomen

Fine, fuck you, I'm a weeb.

But listen: it's a great song. I sincerely think it has that ABBA feel: that musical complexity you expect from classical music, mixed with the idiomatic language and small-stake feelings of the pop song.

Let's head to the ABBA comparison quickly, which I promise you will yield amusing conclusions. Do you know what a Vocaloid is? Probably not... because you're normal. Vocaloid, to not get into the details, is essentially singing produced by software. If you find the recent reliance on autotune odd, then you will find the world of vocaloid _really_ odd. But the software seems to have helped a lot of composers, who don't want to go through the mess of finding a vocalist, and compromising them, a good deal of compositional creativity. Thus, HoneyWorks. If you're familiar with the history of ABBA, you may find it very, very amusing if Andersson and Ulvaeus had the option to not have their wives sing.

To touch on the vocaloid bit lightly, if you're the type who enjoys the timbre and richness of a real human voice, I'm with you, but I do think I have heard a handful of quite-good vocaloid songs that merit discussion on where they fit in the broader sphere of music. Remember that the human voice is a color, and we've been trying to restrain and control that color for centuries, forcing it to do more and more difficult things. We _can_ embrace the fact that every voice has its own idiosyncrasies, but we don't, and not everyone can sing like Mariah Carey. Not that vocaloid is even close to that quality.

If, instead, you think it's just _weird_ that we look to robots for human intimacy, yes, I'm still with you. But I digress.

I know I'm entering tangent upon tangent, but if you look upon the ABBA connection again, you realize that not a few East Asian songs of note have recently taken from the Western pop playbook, with FIFTY FIFTY'S "Cupid" as another example. I remember being thrown off by the latter song upon finding out it didn't originate in Sweden, or something.

To get this out of the way for people who don't speak Japanese (and neither do I): it's a song about a girl bragging about how cute she is. No, don't bother to look up the lyrics, that's _literally what it is_.

Surely someone else can write more about the actual meaning of the lyrics, interpreting them as the flowering of a girl's self-expression. But I don't know the language nor its subtleties, and I'm not a woman, so it's a little like pounding a nail with a boot: I, in this case, am the boot, and it seems like a lot of disrespect for some poor wall. So I will tactfully not touch this subject with a ten-foot pole, and I don't think I really need to, though the lyrical content is worthy of inspection, particularly its relationship with the music.

I think what wins me over almost immediately is that soaring guitar in the song's intro. Again, very ABBA-esque; think of the intro to "Mamma Mia" (which, good God, I talk about that song so much, I should probably write about it). That guitar is the introduction to adventure, which is the pathway down a 14-to-30 year old girl's fancy. Notice how this same guitar vanishes in the verses and re-enters in the chorus; it reiterates its theme in the bridge and adds idiosyncratic melodies in the chorus proper, adding subtly onto the unusual qualities of the song, particularly its motivation.

Then there is that tinkling piano, which I assume is synthetic, accompanying the guitar and dominating the first verse of the song, dancing along with the lyrics. It is conspicuously absent in the lead-up to the chorus and replaced in the second verse by a glockenspiel(?), and returns before the chorus again, more strident than ever because we miss it. As we reach the end of the song, the guitar and piano interchange as if reconciled, which is what our protagonist is.

By the way, in researching this song, I have found - I guess I shouldn't be surprised - there are many, many covers of the song, and I do believe the original is still the best one. Browsing through Apple Music, there is a cover by Kohanaramu (bet that's a robot) where the drums are very prominent in the mix, to the extent they are very distracting. There is a version by TOKINOSORA (no idea who that is) where the guitar is replaced by a horn, so it sounds like ska. I think the instrumentation of the original is capital-P Perfect and achieves the perfect subtlety. Arguably, the song's strongest point is the arrangement.

That being said, some of the lyrics are wonderfully constructed. As an English speaker, I obsess over pronunciation, the sounds our mouths make and concatenate. The repetition of "Daisuki na oyoufuku / daisuki na okeshou de" ("da-ee-su-ki na o-yo-fu-ku / da-ee-su-ki na o-kee-sho dei", notice the dance of "o" and "kuh" sounds) is quite playful, succeeded by the aggressive "okimari no haafu", pronounced "o-ki-ma-ri no ha-ah-fu"; notice how the tongue with "ki" and "ri" are at the jaw and how it rises up at the "ha-ah". (This also shows how unique Japanese phonetics are; English rarely has rough combinations as "ki" and "ma" together, which produce a strong contrast to one another.) Then, in the song's last verse, there's the rapid triplet rhyming with "-ai", ending with the stretched-out "so-re ga wa-ta-shiiiiii", as if the singer were stretching out their thoughts. For pop, it's never really what the words are, it's how the words _sound_ and _feel_, that are more important.

So. Yeah. It's still weird talking about the song - it's _plain_ embarrassing - but it's a very lovely song. It's a song worth studying: it feels like the type of song where every lyric, every note, every second is crafted consciously and perfectly. I do think pop is the closest to classical music, the closest to Mozart we have in our contemporary time. The song also proves something else to me: the song is a song, it proves itself, and _shows_. Even if it is made by robots, even if it is produced by software, it demonstrates the idiosyncrasy and proportion of the human mind. Which belongs to HoneyWorks. Whom we know nothing about. Truly, we live in odd times. Nevertheless, this strangely turns my mind to Wallace Stevens' poem "Mozart, 1935", whose last verse is

We may return to Mozart.<br/>
He was young, and we, we are old.<br/>
The snow is falling<br/>
And the streets are full of cries.<br/>
Be seated, thou.

### Addendum

As a note, I don't think HoneyWorks' other songs are very good.
