### Animation

Probably the first thing people will mention about this Studio Ghibli-produced film is the computer animation; all things considered, it's actually pretty good, almost really good. What's important is that the animation achieves an effect, not just for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1CQNPl_WCs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">better range of movement</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uE4PZi3sk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">because you entirely gave up</a>. In comparison to a Pixar film - which the quality of the animation does arise to - the animation employs a mellower color palette and tends toward a texture that's somewhere between wooden and clay, so that it looks more like <a href="https://yt3.ggpht.com/orpiV_srXQaUGceyaYYBHItYuZe80V9oZQZGAVOsw--LvdAPn1Ui9keM_2lRixup8U8EfgIj4FnG1vUDfQ=s900-mo-c-c0xffffffff-rj-k-no" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallace and Gromit</a> than anything else contemporary.

The animation is actually more effective for this kind of story than a comparative 2D animation. 3D animation tends to be character-focused while 2D animation better emphasizes the environment, background characters and creatures. Most of the stand-out moments in Hayao Miyazaki's (the director's, Goro Miyazaki's, father) come from the juxtaposition of the environment to the characters - for example, the rain in the iconic scene of "My Neighbor Totoro", the use of cloud and the light from Sheeta's pendant in "Castle in the Sky", and the sheer size of the river spirit and the heat of the bath, juxatposed next to Sen's small stature, in "Spirited Away".

I can't pinpoint why precisely; one reason is a fault of 3D animation, in that models tend to lack flesh-like qualities. As a result, 3D characters always stand out compared to their, more natural-looking, surroundings.

Another reason has more to do with inherent style. In 2D animation, the character is a painted object, no different than a flower or a train, so you can blend the character in very well with the setting. In 3D animation, every thing is objectified; it has its own spatial presence, standing apart from everything else.

In any case, "Earwig and the Witch" is a character-focused film, and uses 3D animation very well. From the audience's viewpoint, Earwig is distinct and salient - she has a wonderful range of expression that I thought were funny, and her energetic scurrying around endears her to the audience. In comparison, in a 2D film, characters begin to blend together and it's hard to distinguish between them; only from a storytelling perspective do they actually differentiate. Seeing Earwig actually pick up an object and explore its depth, turn it around and wade into distances, works better for this film because the film is largely confined to one setting; you acquire familiarity with the setting as she does. (This is in sharp contrast to "Spirited Away" where you intentionally never get comfortable with the bath house.)

Furthermore, looking at the purity of the animation (no harsh edges, no obvious stilted animation) and the fluidity of the animation, you pretty much know immediately how hard Ghibli worked on this film. So let's set aside the animation as being a problem; I don't think it's a problem, and it's unlikely to interfere with anyone's enjoyment unless they're a hardcore Ghibli fan.

### Writing

The writing is the worst part of the film by a mile.

The story is not bad. The general gist is, Earwig is an apprentice to a witch and she learns to live with the various inhabitants of her new house as well as learn magic. Because the character is a trickster, and doesn't undergo a dramatic arc, the film skews to being a comedy in the vein of Reynard the Fox.

The writing, however, varies between being bad and being adequate ... _for an anime film_. Anime films are frequently writing disasters, from "Weathering with You" (all filler, most details don't contribute to the plot), to "Promare" (characters and setting are unimportant, nothing is set up), to "Liz and the Blue Bird" (literally no plot). The characters have a clear character (as in, they differentiate from one another) and the character relationships are well established, and the narrative arc is clear (Earwig asserts her independence), but very, very little is set-up.

Right off the bat, Earwig being an orphan has very little to do with anything, except that she misses her fellow orphans. Many of the characters seen in the scenes with the orphans, many of whom Earwig interacts with, have no bearing for the rest of the film. This basically amounts to a huge waste of time.

A witch comes to adopt Earwig because she needs an apprentice; secretly, she and Earwig do not at all share family-like conduct. Earwig is more or less OK with this. Besides quick scenes where Earwig says, "I can't leave this house" or "I hate this woman", she does not make an extended effort to escape or defy the witch's orders. Eventually she plays a prank on the witch, but for what purpose, other than personal amusement or some show of defiance, it is unclear.

The film makes the assumption that the audience knows what magic is; it never really demonstrates what it is or what it does. Sometimes all you need is a simple scene - Sophie in "Howl's Moving Castle" becomes an old woman; _that_ is what magic is, it profoundly transforms a person's life. The film does explain magic can cause rainstorms or ruin a neighbor's flowers, but magic never arises to anything ... _magical_, it's just something that can be done.

There is no reason why Earwig wants to learn magic specifically, except that she think it's cool. A simple scene suffices - a dream sequence where Earwig imagines all of the things she can do with magic. You need this because throughout the film she is very, very insistent to learn magic, but there is no urgency behind her insistence nor necessity; she comes off as a brat.

Earwig's mother has pretty much nothing to do with the film. She's revealed later in the film as being a rockstar, but other than that it absolutely _does not matter_ that she is Earwig's mother.

Speaking of music, it absolutely has nothing to do with the film, other than Earwig and Mandrake, the other inhabitant of the house, bond due to it.

I suppose music makes Earwig's loneliness in the house easier, but Earwig never suffers throughout the film; she's never seen getting sad or feeling pain, except when the witch slaps her, once. Contrast this to "Spirited Away", in the pivotal scene where Chihiro loses her parents; she runs through the crowded streets and finally finds an isolated corner to cry in. Never again does she cry in the film (as I recall); we only needed to see it once to immediately emphathize with her.

There is a cat character in the film who does not talk until he suddenly wants to talk; when he decides to talk, he is unusually chatty. Of the characters in the film, the cat's sudden shift to quiet to talkative goes unexplained and is inconsistent.

Why Mandrake writes instead of pursues any other creative activity, is unexplained. I'm not looking for an expository scene, I'm looking for a simple, "Mandrake is seen reading a book in every dinner table scene" or something similar.

These are all problems with the sequence of the film. _The sequence of the film is more important than the details of the film, by an order of magnitude._ If a film has a proper sequence, it is very enjoyable rewatching it, because you never get bored by it; it is constantly introducing information and then using that information.

This is 100% a problem with the script and possibly the direction given by the director. The ideas are there - the film is a comedy, Earwig is a prankster, the witch is a stuffy tyrant, the cat is Earwig's sidekick and the character with the narrative arc is really Mandrake. But it's far too difficult for the audience to understand these ideas unless they're aware of the tropes and identify each character with the proper trope. As a result, the characters are merely presences onscreen delivering lines, walking to here and there, and they don't unify into anything interesting. _Writing is the unification and clarification of ideas._ An audience should not be doing homework to enjoy the depth of a film.

### Suggestions

Earwig being left to the orphanage should be cut from the movie. If you want to keep it, the film begins with baby Earwig on the doorstep. Earwig's mother is of no importance to the film.

The scene where the children dress up as ghosts is actually a visually interesting scene. I would like to keep it, but it needs to achieve a goal. In the current film, it really just sets up Earwig being a prankster and Earwig hanging out with Thomas. When you have a visually interesting scene, ideally you unify it with a "big" idea - because the audience tends to remember fondly these scenes, they will also fondly remember the themes of the film.

Since magic is pretty much a symbol of human ingenuity, you should probably tie this scene with that theme. You need to clearly establish Earwig being the leader of the group, by dint of wanting to control others. She can lead the kids into an isolated part of the woods (a walking montage that can be accompanied by a 1 minute song, which will appear on the soundtrack, wink wink). They enter a spooky part of the forest and Earwig reads from a book, that then turns into a tirade about being free and independent. Finally, they "exorcise" the orphan who has just been adopted, as a kind of family ritual. The sequence can be refined - I see a lot of problems - but the major point is made: Earwig is a major source of creativity and intelligence, and she is established as wanting to be free. Got it, character established.

The greatest improvement to this sequence is that it transitions well into the next: Earwig being adopted, through the magical connivances of Mandrake and Bella. This shows Earwig has clear antagonists, people who are far more competent than she is in deceiving and manipulating people.

(This makes the assumption we cut out the scene where she meets the orphanage's cooks. She can talk about how much she loves shepherd's pie in the forest scene. "And the bravest, bestest kids live happily ever after in Cockaigne where they eat shepherd's pie, like the one in the orphanage's, every day.")

The scene where Earwig moves to her new home is adequate and shows how unfamiliar her new surroundings are and how little Bella cares about her; it would be nice if Earwig commented on how un-witch-like the witch's house is. ("Where are the gargoyles? The jack o' lanterns and skeleton butlers and stuff?")

The slap needs to be moved here. Bella asserts her authority over Earwig very early on in the film. She then demands Earwig to do gruelling, boring work (1 minute montage here). Earwig does not cry, does not get agitated in any way; she smiles back at Bella in that creepy, plotting Earwig way.

But because Earwig is human, she still needs human comforts. She talks to the cat out of loneliness - though the cat does not talk back - and she snoops around the house, finally finding a magical loophole and retrieving Mandrake's copy of his favorite album. (There's a plothole in the film where apparently Mandrake has more than one copy for some reason. A friend reasoned that since he made the album he'd have multiple, but I don't buy it.)

The next day, Mandrake is FURIOUS and demands Bella find the copy. Unable to find it, Bella is just on her way to blaming Earwig... when Earwig places the blame on the cat, somehow. Bella punishes the cat with worms - the cat's screams indicate that worms are indeed a horrible punishment.

The cat then begins to talk and conspires with Earwig to make an anti-magic potion. Making this potion is so difficult that it might take Earwig's whole summer to create it - in the autumn, she'll be going to school all day and working with Bella all night. Summer is the only time when she'll have the most access to the house.

An interesting twist would be that the cat stops talking once Earwig applies the potion on the cat. Earwig thinks the potion was a failure and, worse, she doomed the cat to muteness. It's just an idea; I don't really know how to get out of it when the cat talks again at the end of the film.

We're now at the end of the second act: Earwig, learning magic, has went up, just to go down again. Up until this point the film has been dropping careful clues about Mandrake, so she decides to use the taciturn tree instead. She's near the end of summer; she doesn't have much else she can rely on.

Throughout the film it's established Mandrake's room is a magical room; she eventually finds a way to access the room consistently. She tries to find the secret behind Mandrake's teleporting spirits (in hopes of being able to use them herself), but the spirits evade her - they're demons after all - and Mandrake finds her out, furious. She scurries out of the room and locks herself into her own room. This is when Bella summons worms upon her - and this is the part of the film where Earwig learns the potion actually worked all along.

Just like in the original film, Earwig maneuvers the worms into Mandrake's room. Mandrake has the philosophy of "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me." He confronts Bella, blaming _her_ on the recent chaos of the household, because she did not treat Earwig with respect.

Earwig, seeing that Mandrake is actually a pretty good guy, returns Mandrake's album back to him. They then talk for a while about Mandrake and Bella's old band and about Mandrake's novel - and about creativity and independence. Earwig realizes that Mandrake's album has personal value to him, because he actually created it. They have a small chat about freedom, which unintentionally gives Earwig a bigger head than she already has - but to the audience, it's a nice sweet cap on the rest of the film.

The film ends as the original film ends - Earwig bossing people around and finally seeing her friend Thomas again.

So there you have it. Notice how all of the details here _are in the original film_. I didn't have to make many things up; I did have to adjust the dialogue and move scenes around, but for the most part it's far more clear what the stakes are and what the character is motivated to do, and how she plans to go about doing it. When you have a film that is clearly meticulously worked on, and is supported by talented people, you need to put in a bit of extra work to make it shine and show all its worthy qualities.
